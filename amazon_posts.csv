2025-10-18,Stop being a bunch of p*****s,"TLDR: Amazon is probably the most misunderstood company in the world.

\* AWS is still the best cloud and has more sustainable growth than Azure, GCP, OCI. 

\* 2nd largest company by revenue behind only Walmart and growing faster and with higher operating margins 

\* 3rd highest advertising revenue behind only Google and Meta and growing fast 

\* 2nd largest streaming service by subscribers behind only Netflix 

\* Asymmetric optionality with Project Kuiper (satellite internet), Zoox (AV), pharmacy/One Medical business 

\* Will directly benefit from the AI and upcoming robotics revolution through fully automated fulfillment and delivery services 

\* Amazon wants to be the platform company which sells all of their logistics and supply chain services to other companies which will have higher margins than selling goods as a first party.

2025-10-07,Thoughts on AWS - OpenAI partnership,"It‚Äôs pretty clear that OpenAI wants access to massive compute and has already partnered with 3 of the top 4 hyperscalers Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. That leaves Amazon as the only major hyperscaler they haven‚Äôt teamed up with yet.

Interestingly, OpenAI made their open-weight models available on AWS in August, which could be a natural starting point for discussions. While Amazon is working closely with Anthropic, the same is true for Google, so that doesn‚Äôt seem to block a potential OpenAI-AWS partnership.

Honestly, an AWS growth re-acceleration could be the catalyst that wakes this sleeper."
2025-10-07,"If you think $NVDA$CRWV$NBIS will keep rising, but not $AMZN, I don't know what to say.","It's either that $NVDA keeps sucking the cash flow, reflecting a healthy revenue & profit structure upon these Mag7s; or that the CapEx becomes a major concern and we see the AI bubble burst for real this time. You can't expect the producer to make a fat fee with only lousy customers.

  
I've been through this with GOOG. While I'm not fond of the saying that history just repeats itself, I do feel that AMZN gets downplayed so much that a single good news could very well pump it. That's just the playbook this year."
2025-10-07,Loopholes in AMZN hiring,"I‚Äôm an international student with MS in CS. I gave an interview at AMZN way back in 22 and was not able to clear it. 

I now see my friends, and their friends, who just got out if college, cheating interviews and getting hired. I believed all of them are getting a 30K hiring bonus and around $120-$140k packages. I‚Äôve heard about this last year, but as of late, I‚Äôve been hearing this way too frequently, a shit load of people getting in by cheating the interviews. One of my friends who graduated this summer got hired, but soon all of his roommates and his girlfriend and his sister got in, wtf! I know some of them, and most of them are dumb to be working at AMZN, I talked with one of them, got a contact for the guys who help them cheat, and seems like they make a shit ton of money too helping people cheat. The whole fucking thing is pretty sophisticated and seems like no one at Amazon gives a fuck. 

I‚Äôm not saying this because I‚Äôm jealous of some dumb people who don‚Äôt even know how to code and can‚Äôt even communicate properly got into Amazon (Maybe a little :)), but the scale of this is so huge that it could potentially affect the company as whole. It‚Äôs 10‚Äôs of millions of üí∏investment being wasted, maybe way more, that will haunt the company in the long run. I know a lot of them get fired eventually, but still, that‚Äôs way too much time and money wasted that could‚Äôve been used for something better. 

As an investor, I‚Äôm more worried about why this only happens at Amazon, I wonder what internal structure is like to let this happen again and again. They just mine through candidate pool and dump all the bad ones, instead of just hiring good ones and retaining them. Maybe it‚Äôs something fundamentally wrong with Amazon, I heard somewhere that their employee turnover rate is 150% ü§Ø.

2025-09-29,Set for a comeback,Stay with me brothers.
2025-09-27,"Built a free tool for day trading US equities, real-time news, analyst ratings, price action alerts, street insights and more","So I‚Äôve been day trading US equities for a while, and one of the biggest frustrations I had was how scattered all the important info is. You‚Äôve got to flip between news terminals, Twitter, SEC filings, market scanners, watch cnbc/bloomberg to get a sense of wallstreet's sentiment etc. By the time you piece things together, the move is usually already gone.

I ended up building a platform for myself that pulls everything into one place in real-time. Figured I‚Äôd share it here in case it helps others:

* **Street Insight:** AI that watches CNBC/Bloomberg interviews in near-real-time, pulls key quotes, tags tickers, and scores sentiment so you know the street‚Äôs take at a glance.
* **Live news feed:** Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, WSJ headlines, Trump tweets in one stream
* **Analyst ratings:** upgrades/downgrades as they happen
* **Price action alerts:** stock spikes 2% in 1 min, oversold rsi, pivot support/resistance levels etc.
* **Company info:** SEC filings, insider activity, press releases
* **Alerts dashboard:** type in a ticker or keyword and instantly see why it‚Äôs moving
* **Front page briefing:** market overview, leaders/laggards, up-to-date news/ratings summaries, etc.

I originally just hacked this together for my own trading, but now it‚Äôs running pretty smoothly so I put it online. It‚Äôs free to use, no paywall. If you log in, you get real-time stock data and push alerts so you don‚Äôt have to refresh the page again and again.

I‚Äôm still iterating on it, but it‚Äôs already been super useful for catching moves early (like when an analyst upgrade hits or a filing drops mid-day).

Curious if anyone here would find this useful / what features you‚Äôd want added?

2025-08-20,Surprised? Nvidia is the ‚Äúmost underweight‚Äù large-cap tech stock,"  
As the world‚Äôs most valuable company and the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of the AI concept, Nvidia has actually become the large-cap tech stock that institutional investors are least willing to overweight.  
  
Morgan Stanley‚Äôs latest research shows that although Nvidia has risen to the top as the world‚Äôs most valuable company, institutional investors‚Äô actual holdings still significantly lag its market position. Analyst Erik Woodring pointed out in the research report that Nvidia has now become ‚Äúthe most underweight large-cap tech stock.‚Äù  
  
Data shows that Nvidia‚Äôs weight in the S&P 500 Index has reached 7.37%, but its share in institutional investors‚Äô average portfolios is only 4.2%, leaving an adjusted underweight gap of as much as 2.41 percentage points. This gap ranks first among the 15 major tech companies tracked by Morgan Stanley.  
  
Analysts believe that this mismatch between holdings and index weight highlights Nvidia‚Äôs unique position. Although the stock has surged nearly 1,300% over the past five years on the back of the AI boom, its rapid rise, along with geopolitical and supply chain-related risks, has caused some investors to remain cautious about significantly increasing their holdings.  
  
Among other large tech stocks tracked by Morgan Stanley, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon are also underweight, though to a lesser extent than Nvidia. Microsoft is underweight by 2.39 percentage points, Apple by 1.66 percentage points, and Amazon by 1.40 percentage points.  
  
In contrast, institutional investors are overweight in certain tech stocks. Intuit is overweight by 0.83 percentage points, Oracle by 0.32 percentage points, and Dell by 0.25 percentage points.  
  
Historical experience shows that underweight stocks often perform better over time, as investors gradually increase their holdings to match their index weight. Analysts said: ‚ÄúThere is a statistically significant relationship between low active holdings and future stock performance.‚Äù

  
Relative stocks to watch: $NVDA $AMD $NBIS $MRVL $TSMC $ASML $BGM

  
**Fundamentals remain solid**  
Despite being underweight, Morgan Stanley analysts remain optimistic about Nvidia‚Äôs fundamentals. In the report, analysts wrote:  
  
‚ÄúLeading indicators of compute demand remain exceptionally strong, with no signs of slowing. As supply chain constraints on rack-level solutions gradually ease, and with the U.S. government advancing export license approvals for China, we continue to view Nvidia as a high-quality asset in the current AI-dominated era.‚Äù  
  
Nvidia‚Äôs stock has risen 35% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 Index‚Äôs roughly 10% gain. Market optimism is mainly driven by demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely used in AI and cloud enterprise applications.  
  
However, not everyone agrees with the optimistic outlook for large-cap stocks. Apollo Management‚Äôs chief economist Torsten Sl√∏k previously stated that the current valuations of large-cap tech stocks and the overall index may be difficult to sustain. He noted that the price-to-earnings ratios of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500, including Meta and Nvidia, have already exceeded the levels seen during the 1999 internet bubble."

2025-06-10,AMZN Breaks Upper Bollinger Band,"Hello,

This is my first post here, so please let me know if this is the wrong area for this type of discussion. I have been learning about different technical indicators within the stock market and developing a guide that describes and simulates different trading strategies. One of the few I have covered so far is Bollinger Bands.

Today, June 9th, 2025, Amazon surpassed an upper Bollinger Band for the second time indicating a strong upward trend. I currently have about 1000$ on Amazon and will make a post when I plan to sell it. Traditionally, breaking the upper band is followed by success within Amazon. There may be a drawback within the next few days that could be a good entering point for people not currently in the stock.

I want to start making posts about what I find and what trades I plan to make. I believe that the proper strategy with any particular stock can yield incredible results and that is what I plan to accomplish with Amazon. I hope to learn from the community and listen to the problems that others have had with similar approaches. I also would love to hear what non-technical people have to say because sometimes instinct knows best within the market.

More than anything I want to post about the strategy I am learning, my implementation of it, and its results. Foolishly, I have not hyper-tuned anything for a ""Walking the bands"" strategy or Bollinger bands alone. However, I have simulated Bollinger Squeezes over the past year with Amazon.

**Bollinger Squeeze**¬†is a scenario where a period of neutrality is followed by a period of volatility. So essentially, after being stagnant, the stock should jump up or down. Generally, the width between bands determines neutrality. By running some simple tests, I can see what width performed best over any specific time period. I found that when the top band minus the lower band is 6-7 we get the best results. But that is hardly important here.

* The current width is 7.357 as of 5:17 PM 6/9/25.
* If we treat that as the minimum width required to trigger a Bollinger Squeeze and apply it to Amazon over the past year then sell a few days later, we achieve an average of 12.36% return rates.
* That is pretty good.

If you are curious how that value is achieved, I simulated buying and selling based on identifying a squeeze. If you find one just buy in. Then once a band is broken, sell x days later. That is as simple as it gets.

In the real world, we just had a squeeze for Amazon, and now we broke the upper band. So selling within a few days will (based on historical data) give you some profit.

The tricky thing is that selling in a few days may not be the best move. Since we are riding the bands. As I said, I have not simulated that yet, so I can't make a buy or sell call yet. However, I will continue developing and analyzing the market based on these indicators. In the future, I want to include ML techniques and quantify the fundamentalist approach as well to create a comprehensive understanding of the market.

If anyone would like access to help develop or learn DM me. I am not trying to promote anything and you will not be charged a dime. I believe in complete transparency and just want to learn the market better.

Best of luck investors.

TLDR; AMZN broke the upper Bollinger band, could be a good time to buy in."
