2025-10-17,Tried trading NVDA on-chain for the first time.. surprisingly seamless?,"I‚Äôve been holding NVDA for quite some time and usually go through my usual broker. Recently though, I tried trading NVDA on-chain just to see how it feels compared to the traditional route. What stood out right away was the flexibility, no fixed trading hours, so I could enter positions anytime, and settlement felt instant.

Another thing I didn‚Äôt expect was how platforms like Bitget are bridging stocks and crypto in one place. I was able to trade NVDA the same way I‚Äôd handle BTC or ETH, and they‚Äôre even giving new users a 100 USDT futures voucher when trading $100 worth of U.S. stock tokens right now. It‚Äôs a small bonus, but it made testing the system risk-free.

Overall, it‚Äôs wild to see how fast this hybrid stock-crypto approach is evolving.  Anyone here has tried stock tokens before? How does your experience compare to traditional trading?"

Anyways, the best thing to do ive figured out in my 18 years of investing is to just buy and hold for years and ignore all the bs!!

We can't control or time the market, thats run by the lizard people, all we can do is ride their coattails and make a modest figure over 25 years!!

NVIDIA‚Äôs got the purest product on the block, top-shelf silicon, CUDA ecosystem, NVLink like a distribution network. Everyone else is either cutting corners or trying to reverse-engineer the formula.

TSMC‚Äôs basically the cartel boss, deciding who gets the next batch of ‚Äúproduct‚Äù (2 nm, 3 nm wafers). AMD might get early access to the new lab, but NVIDIA still owns the street corners, every major buyer, cloud, and datacenter runs their stuff.

The ‚Äúalliances‚Äù and ‚Äúraids‚Äù are wild too. OpenAI siding with AMD to drive prices down, DOJ probes popping up like DEA stings, and suppliers switching sides the moment they smell a better deal.

Beneath the press releases and keynote smiles, it‚Äôs just territory control, exclusivity, and quiet retaliation. Whoever controls the compute supply controls the next digital empire.

2025-10-14,"China Export Limits vs AI Demand, Which Side Wins for NVDA?","I‚Äôve been trading NVDA more actively lately because it‚Äôs sitting at the intersection of two opposing forces: tightening export controls and relentless AI demand. The latest crackdown in China, customs reportedly holding shipments of Nvidia‚Äôs H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips, reminded me how geopolitical friction can instantly shift sentiment. Every headline now feels like a micro-earnings event.

But the flip side is that global AI infrastructure demand hasn‚Äôt slowed. U.S. hyperscalers, Europe‚Äôs AI labs, and startups building on Llama or GPT frameworks are still hungry for compute. Nvidia remains the default supplier, and even limited access to China might just reroute sales elsewhere. That resilience is what‚Äôs kept me cautiously bullish despite the noise.

To stay adaptive, I‚Äôve been trading NVDA through stock futures instead of just holding shares. On Bitget‚Äôs new Universal Exchange setup, I can rotate between crypto and U.S. stock futures depending on where volatility spikes,  NVDA being my main focus. The volume-based leaderboard there adds a bit of structure, keeping me consistent without forcing a bias long or short.

Still, the big question remains: can AI demand outpace regulatory drag? If export curbs expand, valuation might compress fast; if demand stays this strong, NVDA could absorb the shock. Curious how others here are positioning, still holding, trimming, or trading around the noise?"

2025-10-13,Consider a potential AI crash this week.,To offer a contrarion perspective. The AI bubble is set to burst regardless of Crypto or trade discrepancies. The revenue just doesnt match the price inflation. Wallstreet doesnt hold volatile positions. And institutional money is what drove the price surges this last year. Meaning when Wallstreet pulls out its gonna tank the price regardless of retail investors and their Hodl resilience. It always happens that way. If your smart youll sell at at the top while you still can. The AI bubble cant keep growing too far past the current risk delta.

This means Nvidia already has hundreds of billions of dollars of business with OpenAI WITHOUT giving anything in exchange! AMD has solidified themselves as a BACKUP provider. Nothing good about that. 

And the cucks that tried to ride the wave, it's 35% at the open and straight down afterwards! You just got cooked if you bought at open!

Nvidia barely got a scratch, a tiny 1% movement. This means the market has validated Nvidia has AI chip dominance which means MORE companies will buy from Nvidia since the AI market just validated itself yesterday!

Any company with AI involvement (which is every industry eventually) WILL have to BUY BIGLY from NVIDIA!

Hey guys! My trading [model](https://builder.limex.com/dashboard/101128) ranked NVDA 4 points down to #36, but still it holds it as a top security in this portfolio. For those who wants to do some analysis for NVDA, you can check ranking once a week to see if model moves its ranking it up/down. I use it as an indicator for a short term 1 Month investment horizon. In other words - when I see it goes down in ranking 2-3 weeks in a row, I'd think twice before buying more. "

2025-10-02,NVDA momentum + new ways to trade it,"Been following NVDA for a while (like most of you here), and it still amazes me how central the company has become in the AI narrative. Between datacenter demand and the GPU arms race, it feels like NVDA is less of a ‚Äúchip stock‚Äù and more of a core piece of tech infrastructure now.

What‚Äôs been interesting for me personally is exploring different ways to get exposure beyond the traditional broker route. I started experimenting with stock futures trading on Bitget recently mostly NVDA and TSLA. The experience has been closer to how I trade crypto: 24/7 access, quick execution, and low capital entry (even tested it with $5 just to get a feel). To my surprise, they also rolled out an event where trades on trending stock futures (including NVDA) count toward a chance to win Tesla shares, which adds a bit of extra upside.

Not financial advice of course, but it‚Äôs been refreshing to see alternatives open up for people who don‚Äôt want the limitations of regular brokerages. And honestly, it‚Äôs the excitement around companies like NVDA that makes me want to test new ways to stay involved.  
  
Anyone else here has tried trading NVDA outside of traditional markets?"

2025-10-01,How it feels to hold NVD3 for the next 5 years,
2025-10-01,Today is another PUMP day. We are officially in PUMPTOBER.,
2025-10-01,Shutdown just manipulation by the big boyzzz to get better nvda prices folks!!,"Folks, government shutdowns are well known classic elite tactics to reload their billions to make more money for themselves!!  Its greed at its finest!!

All the corrupt officials have already known ahead of time and you'll see tomorrow nvda will sink and they'll reload in a few days or so and you'll see another big pump, at which time the big boyzzz will siphon more working classes 401ks into their pockets to buy more yachts and mansions and get their trophy wives and mistresses new cars and stuff!!

I have no fear cause I know the market is run by the elite greedy crowds and they'll never let it go too low cause this is their lives folks!!  These people live for money and power and thats all they care about!!

If they lose money, they lose power and their hot girlfriends and stuff, and these guys are mostly fat bloated types that cant get women otherwise and they're always horny, even in their 80s!!

I used to live next to one when I came into my millions after grandma left me her real estate and we sold it for $22 million!!  If you don't know my story,  we'll over 18 years , I turned this into almost $280 million.

Now i hang out with some elites and i have 2 yachts so they let me into their circles and tell me all the secrets of the market!!

So yeah, this one guy lives near me , in Boca and he has a $34 million mansion and is about 300 lbs and always has these Russian models around him and they're all very gorgeous!!

He told me a few weeks ago, that they're only with him for his money!!  I felt like telling him we'll duh!!! But I didn't want to hurt his feelings. The guys about 70 now and smokes like a chimney and is always coughing and spitting up crap!!

He wants me to buy his newest yacht cause he cant afford to keep it any longer. But he wants $24 million and thats not something I want to take on right now.

Anyways,  yeah this guy's always telling me about the big boyzzz and how the market is controlled by them and how they cause sell offs a lot to reload their billions!!  I believe him folks!!  He also owns about 30,000 shares of nvda !

Anyways, im here in the trenches watching the fort folks!!

Onward!!

Ive now got about 18,000 shares to defend, just for your info!!

The bears are working diligently to scare out the weak hands and they're using their favorite old standby, the dreaded ""government shutdown "" to pry nvda shares from the weak!!

This happens every year and they make a big deal of it and retail panics and skips meals, etc and gets all upset and then they ""work something out"" last minute as usual!

Its all a big manipulation game to get the poors money into the ultra riches pockets!!

Although im worth about $280 million and have 3 mistresses, a trophy wife and 2 yachts,  I dont consider myself ultra rich folks!! I even still drive a 2003 Honda civic thats rusted pretty bad!!

So anyways, just remember im here for you working the trenches and defending nvda!

 Dont be naive!! Its well known that the market is manipulated and retail gets scammed out of their money via 401ks, while the manipulators walk away with the poors hard earned money!!

There are hedge funds controlling where the market goes every day!! People with billions that make millions influencing buys and sells!!

Right now, nvda is in a classic digestion phase!! Its a classic hedge fund manipulation tactic to wear out weakness via time!!

They make a stock stay in a tight range for a year or so and wear out the confused and weary investors and manipulate news flows!!

Then when people get tired and sell. They swoop in with their millions and scoop up all the discounted shares and next thing you know, we're at 190 and people get fomo!!

2025-09-29,NVIDIA earnings moves rarely match option pricing,"Ahead of earnings, the market often uses option pricing to estimate potential volatility, but in many cases NVIDIA‚Äôs actual price swings have far exceeded those expectations.

Typical examples: In FQ2 2024, implied move was +10.4%, but the stock surged +24.4%; in FQ1 2024, implied +4.7% but the stock actually dipped -0.1%.

There are also cases where implied moves overshot reality ‚Äî e.g., in FQ4 2024, options priced in +10.5%, while the stock moved only +7.0%. Overall, NVIDIA‚Äôs earnings reactions tend to be unpredictable, so we probably should pay close attention to the gap between implied and actual moves, rather than relying solely on options signals.

As of FQ2 2026, the market is pricing in about a ¬±5.9% move following earnings, but the risk of deviation remains significant.

2025-09-26,"In 2006, Huang bet on GPUs beyond gaming while Wall St wrote the idea off‚Ä¶","By 2016, Jensen Huang was already writing about GPUs as the engine of AI.

In 2017, he made it the centrepiece of NVIDIA‚Äôs GTC keynote: The Rise of GPU Computing.

Yet most of Wall Street still saw NVIDIA as ‚Äúthe Call of Duty chip.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the essence of optionality: what looks like a niche gaming company can quietly be building the foundations of a multi-trillion-dollar AI ecosystem.

In my book The Only Bet That Counts, I call these rare companies monsters, businesses with hidden platforms and founder-led vision that can bend markets when the world finally catches up. The hard part isn‚Äôt spotting them in hindsight, it‚Äôs having the conviction to hold them through the early years of noise and doubt.

So here‚Äôs my question for the NVIDIA community: Are there any companies you have spotted now building infrastructure that looks boring, but could become indispensable in 10 years?"
2025-09-26,Neutral rate estimates suggest Fed may not be overly restrictive,"The chart compares three models estimating the ‚Äúneutral rate.‚Äù Assuming 2% inflation, most estimates fall between 3% and 4.2%.

Overall, Fed policy may not be as ‚Äúoverly tight‚Äù as markets fear.

The stock has been insane but honestly I never bothered with brokers because of all the KYC and funding hurdles. Felt like too much work just to size in small and test stuff.

Lately I tried a different approach with tokenized NVDA futures that trade the same way I do crypto. It‚Äôs just USDT, open 24/7, and feels strange but kind of natural at the same time. I even tossed in 5 bucks on Bitget (partnered with OndoFinance for these RWA pairs) just to see how it works.

It‚Äôs obviously not the same as holding real shares, but for someone who trades perps a lot, having NVDA right next to BTC and ETH is a wild shift. Makes me think if this actually creates more liquidity and exposure for Nvidia or if it just waters down the whole idea of owning equity.

I‚Äôm not a long-term holder like many of you. I only entered NVDA this year after one of my cash-secured puts was assigned. My average cost ended up at 139.70 for a total of 7,100 shares. After entering, I experienced turbulence when the stock dropped to 85‚Äîit was stomach-churning, with unrealized losses reaching about 310K.


Since I usually run the wheel strategy, I was selling covered calls weekly. However, this time I decided to write 3-month calls, assuming NVDA wouldn‚Äôt cross 155 before September 19. But then it surged to 188, causing an unrealized loss of 185K on my calls. By expiry, the stock settled around 175‚Äì176. My calls got assigned, and I booked a profit of 156K, though I missed out on the upside because of the covered calls.

Intel and Nvidia are working on custom data center CPUs that Nvidia will integrate into its AI platforms as well as GPU tiles that Intel will integrate into its upcoming client processors. In both cases CPUs and GPUs will use Nvidia's NVLink technology as an I/O interface. By now, there are three teams working together on the joint projects.

The work began around a year ago, and preliminary agreements were reached by Intel's then-CEO Pat Gelsinger and Nvidia's Jensen Huang even before that.

At that point, I made the horrible decision of dropping $5K into Nvidia stock on August 18th, just two days before it would plummet to less than $170.00. Since then, the stock has been all over the place. There have been multiple instances where I've almost broken even, just for it to fall back to $170.00.

I'm investing in Nvidia for the long-term, so day-to-day fluctuations now aren't gonna matter in 5 - 10 years from now, but man did I choose a horrible time to buy in. I could've doubled my $5K by now if I had bought-in in April when it was $95.00 a share. Hindsight is 20/20, as they say.

It's also frustrating because I already had like $10K worth of FXAIX, which I could've traded for Nvidia stock back in April. Oh well. üòÖ"

2025-09-17,Geopolitics Take,"Just wanted to bounce some thoughts off you guys and see if anyone has anything to add.

I'm trying to kind of parse the incredibly complex geopolitical dance going on between the US and China with Nvidia in the middle and this is my intuition:

The US wants Nvidia to sell into China - I think this is fairly obvious. Just go listen to everything David Sacks has said on this topic over the past year+ - Go listen to all in, etc. The idea is that we want China building on a US hardware stack. All the big shots in silicon valley are saying this, and they all have Trump's ear.

I think this entire ordeal with Nvidia is a charade. The Trump admin is trying to use Nvidia as leverage, but ultimately they WANT Nvidia to sell into China. I believe that China knows this. If its obvious to me, its obvious to China. They are calling his bluff by saying ""Stop buying Nvidia"" - This is the last thing you want to hear as the Trump admin. What trump wants is to hang Nvidia over their head AS IF he doesn't want them to sell there, so that he can leverage this into a favorable US-China deal. This is classic art of the deal. Get the opponent to give you something in exchange for nothing, pay you to do what you wanted to do all along because you feign otherwise.

China is playing this perfectly though in my opinion, and trump will have to fold in this area.

At the end of the day, I think Nvidia will sell into China. All parties involved want this outcome. For that reason I see this as a buying opportunity."
2025-09-17,How big a blow is China‚Äôs Nvidia ban for AI competition?,"China‚Äôs Cyberspace Administration told major tech groups, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and cancel orders of Nvidia‚Äôs RTX Pro 6000D, a GPU custom-built for the country. 

The ban goes further than earlier restrictions on the H20 chip and follows regulators‚Äô conclusion that domestic processors now match Nvidia‚Äôs China-market models. SMIC is testing 28nm deep-ultraviolet lithography machines with multi-patterning to reach 7nm chips, though these remain years behind TSMC‚Äôs 2nm EUV output.

2025-09-15,Asked AI For some DD After Asking About Todays China News.,"# NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis: Likelihood of Reaching $185 by November 1, 2025

As of September 15, 2025 (pre-market), NVDA's last close was $177.82 on September 12. With the recent China antitrust news, shares are down approximately 2.4% in pre-market trading, putting the price around $173.55. The target of $185 represents about a 6.6% gain from this level over the next 35 trading days (from September 15 to October 31, 2025, excluding weekends and with no major U.S. stock market holidays in this period). This analysis incorporates chart insights across multiple time frames, historical daily percentage changes, and a probabilistic model based on past performance.

# Charts on Multiple Time Frames

Using available data from recent analyses:

* **Daily Time Frame**: NVDA is in a short-term consolidation phase after hitting an all-time high of $184.48 on August 12, 2025. The stock has been trading in a downward channel since then, with recent closes around $177-178. Key support is at $170-175 (recent lows), and resistance at $182-184 (near the ATH). Moving averages show the price just below the 50-day MA (\~$178) but well above the 200-day MA (\~$142), indicating a long-term uptrend but near-term weakness. Oscillators are neutral: RSI (14-day) around 50 (not oversold), MACD showing a bearish crossover but flattening, suggesting potential for a rebound if volume increases. Overall daily signal: Buy.
* **Weekly Time Frame**: Up +5.83% in the past week, reflecting resilience despite broader pressures. The weekly chart shows a strong uptrend over the year (+52.19%), with support at $160-170 (prior consolidation zones) and resistance at $185-190 (psychological and extension from ATH). Moving averages remain bullish, with the stock above key weekly MAs. RSI is balanced (\~55-60), and MACD shows positive momentum. Signal: Strong Buy for 1-week horizon.
* **Monthly Time Frame**: Down -2.63% month-to-date, amid geopolitical noise and post-earnings digestion. However, the longer-term monthly trend is upward, with NVDA up over 50% year-to-date. Support at $140-150 (June lows), resistance at $190-200 (analyst targets). Monthly RSI (\~60) indicates room for growth without overbought conditions, and MACD maintains a bullish bias. Signal: Buy for 1-month.

Volatility is moderate at 1.22%, with a beta of 2.05 (high relative to the market). Patterns suggest a potential bullish flag on weekly/monthly charts, but the daily shows caution due to the China probe. Analyst consensus remains Strong Buy, with targets ranging $100 (low) to $389 (high), averaging $204-217 (15-25% upside).

# Past Average Day-to-Day % Increase

Based on the last \~75 trading days (from late May to September 12, 2025), the average daily percentage increase is approximately 0.41% (arithmetic mean of daily changes). This reflects NVDA's growth amid AI demand, though with volatility‚Äîdaily log returns have a mean of 0.39% and standard deviation of 1.70%. Over this period, the stock rose from \~$132 to $177.82, a cumulative \~34% gain, but with swings (e.g., +4-5% days offset by -3% drops). This historical drift supports upward bias but highlights risk from events like the antitrust probe.

# Likelihood of Reaching $185 by November 1

To estimate this, I used a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model based on the historical mean daily log return (Œº ‚âà 0.39%) and volatility (œÉ ‚âà 1.70%), simulating 100,000 price paths over 35 trading days from the pre-market price of $173.55.

* **Probability**: Approximately 75%. This comes from both single-step (75.1%) and multi-step (75.0%) simulations, assuming random walk behavior.
   * **How the Calculation Works**: The model assumes stock prices follow a lognormal distribution. For each simulation path:
      * Start at S‚ÇÄ = $173.55.
      * For each day t: S\_t = S\_{t-1} √ó exp((Œº - 0.5œÉ¬≤) + œÉZ), where Z is a standard normal random variable.
      * After 35 days, check if S\_{35} ‚â• $185.
      * Aggregate: Fraction of paths meeting the target gives the probability.
   * This is a closed-ended math problem, so here's the transparent reasoning: With positive drift (Œº > 0), the expected price after 35 days is \~$185-190 (S‚ÇÄ √ó exp(ŒºT)), aligning with the target. High œÉ (volatility) widens outcomes, but the upward bias yields \~75% odds. If volatility spikes (e.g., from news), probability could drop to 60-70%; lower volatility might push it to 80%.

This probability assumes historical trends continue (no major disruptions beyond current news) and doesn't account for dividends (NVDA's yield is low \~0.02%) or discrete events like earnings (next Q3 report likely late November, post-target). Geopolitical risks (e.g., China probe) could weigh, but strong AI fundamentals and analyst optimism suggest resilience. Recent X sentiment is mixed, with some viewing the dip as a buy opportunity amid partnerships (e.g., with Meta).

In summary, charts show bullish long-term trends with short-term caution, historical averages indicate steady growth, and modeling gives a high (\~75%) likelihood of hitting $185 by November 1‚Äîmaking NVDA potentially undervalued for AI-driven upside, though monitor volatility."

2025-09-06,I am really grateful to this sub for talking me out of holding onto my 185$ calls expiring on 26th.,"I am primarily a Index fund holder. I don't buy any individual stocks ever. I do a bit of options trading. But it's mostly CSPs + CCs. Nothing crazy. Most of those are small insignificant trades. I never lost any money on those. Like I have mostly been a seller of options contracts. I very rarely buy options contracts.

This was maybe the second or a third time I bought an options contract. I was being greedy. Like a lot of people rightly said I was gambling with money.

I sold my position after reading everyone's comments. And I am really glad I did that. If I held my calls, Theta decay would have made them worthless. Plus, I got IV crushed too I assume, since I bought those calls barely a day after the earnings call. Whatever residual IV was leftover from the earnings call faded away.

Beyond everything, the biggest mistake I think I made was that I got into a position thinking that the stock price will bounce back. I had no thesis to back my trade. I was just speculating.

Fortunately I walked away with just a 10K loss on a 25K position. Had I held onto that position, I would be looking at a 24K loss right now. I see that 10K as a price you have to pay for education. There is a lot for me to learn here before I start throwing my hard earned money on options."

For the recent stock market, I'm eyeing on NVDA, GOOG, BGM, BRK, GEMI"
2025-09-05,Why Kura Oncology Stands Out,
2025-09-04,"NVDA crashes 6.38% despite crushing earnings, time to back up the truck at $170?","Classic NVDA move right here. Absolutely crushed earnings with $30B revenue (vs $28.7B expected) and 122% YoY growth, but the market decided to dump it 6.38% after hours to $116.88 because China revenue dropped 24%.

Data Center pulled in $26.3B - that's 154% growth and 88% of total revenue. EPS came in at $0.68 beating the $0.64 estimate, up 168% YoY. Gross margins at 75.1% and they're guiding $32.5B for Q3. But apparently China's revenue share falling from 10% to 6.7% is enough to wipe $93B in market cap.

We've seen this movie before with NVDA. Earnings beat, initial selloff, then moonshot to new highs like $180. RSI hit 45 which is oversold territory and volume spiked to 120M shares (50% above average) - classic panic selling with the VIX sitting calm at 14.12.

I'm eyeing that $170-$172 level as the dip buy opportunity. Risk/reward looks solid for a swing to $190 with a stop around $165. The forward PE dropped to 35x so we're getting better value. Non-China markets grew 73% which shows diversification is working.

Free cash flow hit $13.5B with $7.5B in buybacks, and guidance came in above consensus. Only wildcard is how AVGO earnings impact the sector - expected $14.92B revenue could either validate AI demand or create competitive pressure.

Anyone else thinking this slide from recent highs to current levels is just another classic overreaction? Or are the China headwinds with those export restrictions actually something to worry about long-term?"

2025-09-01,NVDA and I Deliver in Q2! Earnings Actuals Update,"**TL;DR at the Bottom--Long Post But Worth a Read** 

Previous Posts: [Buyback Callout](https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1muu2mu/two_overlooked_facts_about_nvda_q2_earnings_that/), [Final Reddit Estimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1ml3xdj/final_nvda_q2_earnings_estimates_a_new_challenger/)

I had to wait until the weekend to create a comprehensive, high-quality (human) post about NVDA‚Äôs Q2 report. The sub received many surface-level analyses and AI posts following the report, but the numbers show I have quietly dominated the NVDA retail analysis space.

# The numbers to back it up:

I have gone head-to-head with the analyst consensus over the past three quarters, and last quarter, I added an estimate from GPT-5 to represent a bullish argument and provide another benchmark for comparison. 

[My Performance vs Analysts and Actuals Q4 and Q1 EPS](https://preview.redd.it/8f7nkzu0lkmf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ef4fb8242379a07076a95b37468dabd94f2173d)

[My Performance vs Analysts and Actuals Q4 and Q1 Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/30zprl43lkmf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e7902dbd6afb046aba686db58776dcf05fe84f)

In the above two quarters, I significantly outperformed consensus expectations and provided a more detailed forecast. 

This quarter, I added GPT-5, which served as the most bullish estimate. I estimated $46.4 billion in revenue, which was slightly ahead of analysts' expectations at $46.00 billion. GPT-5 estimated over $47.1 billion and echoed sentiment from the most bullish investors.

[My Q2 Revenue Estimate \(Left\), Actual Revenue \(Middle\), GPT-5 Revenue Estimate \(Right\)](https://preview.redd.it/iml53we8lkmf1.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=b80a4542263415d5c9e9f747fea40d885e847d5e)

The above graph illustrates revenue by segment for my and GPT‚Äôs estimates and the actual results. It appears that my job is not in danger of being replaced by AI just yet, and I am extremely happy with how my revenue estimate turned out.

My estimate also did a solid job projecting costs, margins, shares outstanding, and buybacks. I will say that guidance was a weak point in my analysis, and I am working on a solution. 

[Full Breakout of My Estimates vs Results](https://preview.redd.it/zeuecpoilkmf1.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e644b939fb938acb10eef244b7cfaddde4cb0c6)

I am particularly happy with the cost and shares outstanding estimations, and my post outlined an expectation of $50 billion buyback re-up, so the extra $10 billion seems solid. Higher margins and slightly lower costs, along with my slightly lower revenue, caused a $0.02 EPS variance. 

While GPT-5 was able to correctly get to $1.05, its estimates came with a lot more variance and canceled out more favorably. 

[GPT-5 Breakdown vs Results](https://preview.redd.it/xi89zpxnlkmf1.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=76ecf668fe5f848031bc6afe6256fb67f5bbb23a)

GPT-5‚Äôs bright spots were EPS and Guidance, while revenue and shares outstanding were slightly off. Costs came in line with AI‚Äôs forecast, but margins were better, and revenue and shares were lower than actuals. Overall, GPT-5 was still more accurate than the broader Wall Street Consensus, so it was not fully a gimmick to add its estimates. 

# What Was Strong in the Report:

Shifting from myself to the actual company, there was a lot to like in this earnings print. While I did not hear a **‚ÄúHang these earnings in the Louvre‚Äù** from Dan Ives, it was a strong report. 

First, revenue is still strong. While there is plenty of chatter about Data Center softness (missing some estimates by $1-200 million), the growth story is still fully intact. While some are concerned about concentration risk in NVDA‚Äôs customers, the company itself feels strongly about the continued commitment of these buyers. It is shown in the aggressive guidance and strong language on the conference call. 

Some see the guidance not including China's revenue as concerning. However, the call did shed some light on the situation by saying restrictions easing could lead to an additional $2-5 billion in Q3 revenue.

[NVDA Gaming Segment Revenue by Calendar Quarter and QoQ Growth Rate](https://preview.redd.it/6o9mdpqxlkmf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=70cb4c1d175d0847878b80353c1de81518e6ccd6)

Gaming continuing to show strength is a good sign. Growth was starting to stagnate in this segment until a surprise record in Q1 from Nintendo Switch strength, which has continued into Q2. NVDA remains a top player in this market and has rebounded better in this area than AMD. The two companies both experienced a \~25% decline in revenue in Q4; however, Q1 for AMD only saw about half of NVDA‚Äôs 52% rebound. Even with a slight outperformance in Q2, NVDA is winning here and still performing well in the all-important Data Centers. 

Margins are returning to the mid-70s, like Colette Kress and NVDA emphasized. 72.3% was higher than any estimates for Q2, and the company guided for 73.5% in Q3. The concern last year was about margins shrinking due to scaling and competition, and the promise of a return to the mid-70s is being fulfilled. This year, the concerns are Data Center revenue and China, and the worst-case scenario is being priced into the stock. 

# What To Keep Watching:

While I am not worried about Data Centers, I definitely expected a bit more this quarter. While my initial post was titled ‚ÄúMuted Results but Booming Guidance,‚Äù I still wanted to see a bit more growth in this segment ($41.1B vs $41.5B exp.).

Prof. Visualization and Robotics & Auto are still irrelevant. The two segments did see sequential growth in Q2. However, with the hype around robotics right now and the AI design space as an open opportunity, it would have been a nice surprise to see more growth in these segments. 

Gaming has saved a revenue miss two quarters in a row. This quarter, if gaming did not set another record with a surprise $4.3 billion, the total revenue would have been light. This quarter was even less of a surprise than Q1, which was almost a whole $1 billion beat in the segment. The headline number is appearing strong, but outperformance is really coming from gaming. 

# Stock Split?

This is just a bonus, but if you are thinking that NVDA will split again soon, I have bad news for you. NVDA currently has just over 24.5 billion shares outstanding. For reference, TSLA and AMZN are two of the most recent MAG7 splits. AMZN has about 10 billion shares outstanding after its 2022 split, and TSLA has about 3.5 billion after its split the same year. AMZN could announce another 2:1 split and still have 20% fewer shares outstanding than NVDA. It will be a while before it splits again. 

# Price Targets:

There have been quite a few posts about price targets, and people have some insane strike prices in mind. After the results, analyst price targets (which are for 1 year from now) have been raised to an average of around $225/share. I agree with this sentiment overall, and think between 25-30% growth in the next year is the right level of optimism. Of course, things can get volatile in the short term. The raised PT reflects my optimism in continued growth next year. 

# Positions:

[Current NVDA Positions](https://preview.redd.it/z7z9yisemkmf1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb98ca5358be64e68f5996c852eef43ec5c0d44)

I have 200 shares at about $127, along with 2 Covered Calls that are currently just OTM that expire in December. On earnings, I sold a $170 strike put expiring 8/29, which I closed for about $1.00 premium gain. On Friday‚Äôs drop, I sold the $175 put for 9/5. If assigned, I will sell a third $175 call, and my average price for those 100 shares will be in the high 150s (3.5 collected on the put \~15 premium selling the CC).

2025-09-01,NVIDIA‚Äôs Next Big Move: Why This Stock Could Skyrocket,
2025-09-01,Are most ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù regarded nowadays?,"I‚Äôm part of many investing subreddits, and I see a common theme everywhere. Vast majority are perma-bulls, and can‚Äôt accept any realistic perspective where the stock trades sideways or goes down. A lot of gamblers buying call options with insane OTM strikes hoping to become millionaires. No understanding of fundamentals, bought the stock because their best friend or hairdresser told them to. 

$NVDA is very very richly valued. The most valuable company in the world at $4.5T market cap. It is priced for perfection, to the point where even future revenue streams like robotics are already accounted for. It is going down right now because smart money is worried the growth rates aren‚Äôt sustainable. QoQ growth is slowing rapidly, and although Jensen sees $3-4T of data center spend by 2030, it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess how much of that will go to $NVDA, or even if that estimate will come true. People forget that Jensen‚Äôs job is to pump the stock, make $NVDA sound like an unstoppable force that will forever dominate the chip market. Of course he isn‚Äôt going to talk about rising competition or software efficiencies that might decrease the need for compute. Heck, he tried to downplay quantum, took the whole sector down 50% and then had to backtrack on it when quantum started to show serious promise. Why? Because quantum is a threat to $NVDA chips. 

TLDR - I‚Äôm seeing a lot of regarded posts of people gambling on options or buying leveraged ETFs or just ridiculous bull cases. So I just thought I‚Äôd remind everyone that stocks don‚Äôt always go up, especially when it‚Äôs already the most valuable company in the world. Hopium is not a strategy, and many will learn a difficult lesson. 

Everyone else who just buys and holds and doesn‚Äôt trade this stock are going to make a lot of money. As much as people hate Cramer, he‚Äôs right - ‚Äúown it, don‚Äôt trade it‚Äù

2025-08-30,NVDA post-earnings dip: buy the slowdown or wait for more blood?,"After watching NVDA's latest earnings reaction, I'm seeing a lot of mixed sentiment here and wanted to share some thoughts. The company delivered another solid beat with 56% YoY growth in data centers, but the market's lukewarm response tells the whole story - we've gotten so used to NVDA absolutely crushing expectations that ""just"" beating them feels disappointing. The deceleration from 73% growth last quarter to 56% this quarter, while still incredible by any normal standard, shows that even NVDA can't maintain hypergrowth forever. Trading around $174 now, we're about 6% off the recent highs of $184.48 but well above the 52-week low of $86.62.

What's really interesting is the shift in market psychology - momentum traders who rode the hype wave are starting to step back, while disciplined long-term investors are waiting for better entry points. For short-term traders, the risk/reward isn't as appealing anymore with valuation still stretched and momentum cooling. But for those with a multi-year horizon, any significant pullback from current levels could be an opportunity to buy into one of the strongest secular growth stories of our time. The long-term AI thesis is still rock solid - NVDA's CUDA moat and ecosystem advantages aren't going anywhere - but we're finally seeing more realistic pricing expectations. What's everyone's take on the current setup? Are you waiting for further dips or accumulating at these levels?"

Here are his main conclusions:

	1.	Increased Confidence for 2026
He believes Nvidia‚Äôs growth prospects through 2026 look strong, so his earnings estimates are moving higher.

	2.	Raised Earnings Projections

His new EPS (earnings per share) estimates are:

	‚Ä¢	CY25 (calendar year 2025): $4.53 (up from $4.45)

	‚Ä¢	CY26 (calendar year 2026): $7.00 (up from $6.80)

	3.	Potential for Even Greater Upside

He continues to see potential for Nvidia to achieve $8+ EPS in CY26E, which suggests he thinks the company could outperform even his raised estimates.

üëâ In short: Muse expects Nvidia‚Äôs earnings to keep climbing, with strong momentum into 2026, and he sees further upside beyond his current models.

What do you think? What else could make this stock move? "
2025-08-28,Here are the key points & takeaways from the Nvidia earnings call yesterday.,"**Growth in Infrastructure guided to be very strong:**

* CEO expects massive continued growth with ""very, very significant forecast"" from large customers for next year.¬†
* ‚ÄúOver the next 5 years, we're going to scale into a $3 to $4 trillion AI infrastructure opportunity. Essentially $2B in compute spend‚Äù.
* ‚ÄúCapex from the top four CSPs has doubled and grown to about $600 billion. We are at the beginning of this build-out‚Äù
* CRWV higher on the comments. NBIS wasn't but should follow.¬†

**DATA CENTER REVNUES HIGHLY CONCNETRATED**

* They disclosed that one customer drove 23% of ¬†Q2 sales ($10.8B) and another 16% ($7.5B). That‚Äôs nearly $18.3B combined, all tied to Compute & Networking (data center)
* HIGHLY LIKLEY TO BE AMZN AND MSFT.¬†
* Cloud service providers about 50% of Q2 data center revenue

**Supply constraints:**

* ""Everything is sold out. H100s sold out. H200s are sold out"" with hyperscalers ""renting capacity from other CSPs."" Long-term sees growth into the $600B annual hyperscaler CapEx market through ""the decade.""

**On CHINA:**

* ""The China market, I've estimated, to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year"" - expecting it to ""grow say, 50% per year"" like the rest of the AI market.
* There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.¬†
* ‚ÄúWe have not included H20 in our Q3 outlook as we continue to work through geopolitical issues.‚Äù
* We could ship between $2B-$5B worth of H20 chips to China if tensions ease. They also noted that with more orders, they could increase billing.
* While U.S. officials have talked about a possible 15% revenue-sharing requirement, no formal regulation has been put in place yet.

**RUBIN platform already in production, already taped out:**

* Rubin platform already in production: ""six new chips...have all taped out to TSMC"" representing ""3rd generation NVLink Rack Scale AI supercomputer"" with ""much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain.""

**Bullsih commentary on robotics:**

* ""The age of physical AI has arrived unlocking entirely new industries in robotics, industrial automation, every industry in every industrial company, will need to build two factories.""

**Blackwell:**

* ¬†Blackwell will be ""the lion's share"" of the $7B sequential data center growth - ""you should expect Blackwell again to be the driver of the growth"" for Q3 guidance beat.¬†

**Sovereign demand is red hot:**

* We‚Äôre on track to generate over $20B in Sovereign AI revenue this year.‚Äù The EU also plans to invest $20B to build 20 AI factories across France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, including five gigafactories."

2025-08-28,NVIDIA vs AMD: Which Stock Wins in 2025?,
2025-08-28,"Nvidia‚Äôs $46.7B Q2 surge and $60B buyback highlight strength, but margins slip","Nvidia crushed Q2 FY25 with revenue up 56% Y/Y to $46.7B, powered by $41.1B from its Data Center segment and broad adoption of the Blackwell architecture across cloud, gaming (+14% Q/Q), and professional visualization (+18% Q/Q). 

To reinforce confidence, the board approved a massive $60B in new buybacks, bringing the total to $71.2B. But not all signals point up ‚Äî gross margin slid 2.7 pts to 72.4% as Nvidia shifted to selling complex full-scale data center systems, while a $4.5B charge from H20 export restrictions hammered first-half profitability.

With R&D expenses up 39% and just two customers accounting for nearly 40% of Compute & Networking revenue, Nvidia‚Äôs dominance comes with heavy execution and regulatory risks."

2025-08-27,Nebius AI - Nvidia partner to invest in before earnings?,"Our thesis is built off the expanding growth of AI and the need for infrastructure to allow smaller AI startups to succeed in this new world. Most small companies right now can not afford to go out ans build their own data centers to compete with major players, let alone get the GPUs needed to do exactly what they are deciding to do, which could be from everything from biotech AI to fitness AI. Right now, AI companies are fighting over who can get the most GPUs and offer the fastest, cheapest cloud services. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google own most of the market currently, and have a stronghold on the industry. We think over the next couple of years with NVIDIA‚Äôs backing, lots of fresh funding, and perks like free credits and guaranteed GPU access, Nebius could position itself in a prime situation to cater to smaller companies who are looking to enter into AI. Companies are quickly realizing that the world of AI is an eat or be eaten world and will be quick to throw capital expenditure into incorporating AI into their business. If Nebius keeps moving at their current pace, they could become one of the largest ‚Äúnew cloud‚Äù providers powering the next wave of AI companies. Although we always like to be hevaily invested into Nvidia, Microsoft, and other tech giants, it is important to diversify and find every angle of this new AI age. As of now our newsletters have suggested energy companies, AI infrastructure, and the future of banking. We believe Nebius is still a buy right now around $70 and sit in our portfolio as a long-term stock. We think the future will continue to be bright and cannot wait to see where this stock takes off."
2025-08-27,These are the key issues to watch heading into the NVDA earnings tonight. The earnings will be won or loss on the basis of these key issues. Trader positioning into the print is currently bullish. Lots of gamma on 185C in particular.,"* Implied move is 6%.
* Nvidia represents a 8% stake in SPY, 10% of QQQ, 22.5% of SMH.¬†

**KEY ISSUES FOR THE EARNINGS REPORT TO FOCUS ON, AS WELL AS MY COMMENTARY ON THESE TOPICS:**

**Overall demand:**

* Overall demand is strong, with Texas data centers adding 40GW of new power demand. The four major CSPs‚Äô 2026 Capex forecast was raised by $75 billion in July, reaching nearly $400 billion, with capital intensity expected to rise to 41%, almost double that of 2023.

**China:**

* H20 demand remains uncertain: on the one hand, customers are being discouraged from purchasing; on the other hand, projects such as Deepseek R2 were delayed due to lack of H20. AI firm DeepSeek delayed its R2 model after struggling to train it on Huawei‚Äôs Ascend chips, which Chinese authorities pushed them to use instead of NVDA chips.
* Overall, China‚Äôs market is expected to restore several billion dollars of revenue per quarter, but the question will be how quickly China can come back. For reference, Nvidia expected \~$20B from China before the restrictions and write-offs.¬†

**MARGINS:**

* Margins will be the key issue here. ¬†There has been talk of potential margin pressure on early GB300 ramps the the market will want clarity on.¬†
* Also, a 15% license fee will be incurred on Chinese revenue, which is expected to impact gross margin by 50‚Äì60bps. There has been speculation that Nvidia will offset that with price hikes, which we will have to see confirmation of. ¬†FQ3 gross margin is expected to be 73.5%.
* Roughly one-third of survey respondents expect gross margin to be \~58%, while the other two-thirds are still clustered around 65‚Äì72%, despite the sell-side consensus remaining at 71.1%.
* So its a pretty mixed field on margins:, and they will be a key point of interest for this print.¬†

**New Markets:**

* Saudi AI firm Humain, has broken ground on its first data centers in Riyadh and Dammam. Operations are set for early 2026, each starting with up to 100MW capacity. Tareq Amin says Humain has approval to buy 18,000 of Nvidia‚Äôsnewest AI chips, pending U.S. clearance.¬†

**Blackwell GPUs:**

* GPU output increased +20% QoQ in CQ2 and is expected to rise another +30% in CQ3, reaching about 5 million units for the year, with an ASP of about $33,000. Very strong: Hon Hai expects Q3 cabinet shipments of about 4.6k units (vs 1.15k in Q2), while Quanta confirmed that customers are ramping Blackwell Ultra.¬†
* xAI to purchase 300K Blackwell B200 GPUs, per Elon Musk comment
* Oracle commited to purchase 400K Nvidia GB200 (\~$40 billion purchase)
* CRWV tested a 16-GPU NVIDIA H100 system against just four GPUs on the new NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 infrastructure and observed over 6x higher raw throughput per GPU on the GB300.

**New products:**

* NVDA just launched its Jetson Thor robotics computers, built for ‚Äúphysical AI‚Äù in industries like logistics, healthcare and manufacturing.¬†
* We may get more updates on robotics products.¬†"

2025-08-27,All eyes on Nvidia: stock futures rise before key earnings test,"Nvidia‚Äôs upcoming results are being treated as a make-or-break moment for the broader market. With the biggest weighting in the S&P 500 and a central role in the AI investment theme, its earnings could either extend the 2025 rally or trigger another pullback. 

Futures edged higher Tuesday night ‚Äî Dow +29 pts, S&P +0.7%, Nasdaq +0.1% ‚Äî as investors positioned ahead of the report. The upbeat tone was fueled by MongoDB‚Äôs 28% surge and Okta‚Äôs 6% jump after both beat Wall Street expectations, citing stronger demand from companies building AI platforms. PVH also rose nearly 6% on stronger-than-expected earnings. 

Despite Nvidia beating consensus in 11 of the past 12 quarters, the stock sold off after earnings in four of those instances, a reminder of how high the bar is. 

As Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee put it, investors are anxious but still view Nvidia as ‚Äúone of the most important companies in the world in the middle of the biggest structural change in the world economy.‚Äù"

2025-08-25,Nvidia stock price target raised to $225 from $195 at Baird on GB200 momentum,"[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \- Baird raised its price target on¬†[Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)](https://www.investing.com/equities/nvidia-corp)¬†stock to $225.00 from $195.00 on Monday, maintaining an Outperform rating, citing ""significant acceleration in GB200 sell-through shipments in July."" The semiconductor giant, currently valued at $4.34 trillion, has demonstrated remarkable growth with revenue surging 86% year-over-year.

The research firm expects ongoing shipment momentum for Nvidia‚Äôs products, with xAI shipments weighted toward the fourth fiscal quarter. Baird also noted that its initial 2026 outlook for¬†[TSMC](https://www.investing.com/equities/taiwan-semicond.manufacturing-co)‚Äôs CoWoS-L capacity is expected to nearly double year-over-year. With an impressive gross margin of 70.11%,¬†[InvestingPro](https://www.investing.com/pro/NVDA)¬†data shows Nvidia maintains strong profitability while scaling operations.

According to Baird, Nvidia‚Äôs GB300 remains on track for an initial late September launch and represents a significant performance improvement over GB200. The new product has been sampling for the past few months to key data center ODMs with no system-level implementation issues reported.

The firm believes the AI GPU competitive landscape remains ""very favorable"" to Nvidia for the second half of this year and next year. Baird also highlighted that Nvidia‚Äôs Spectrum-X is gaining continued traction at new public cloud data centers, along with xAI and¬†[Meta](https://www.investing.com/equities/facebook-inc).

Baird further noted that Nvidia‚Äôs Cloud Partners initiative is rapidly expanding, targeting enterprise private clouds for GPU as a service and AI as a service, while ConnectX-8 is targeting 80-90% market share in AI servers.

In other recent news, Nvidia introduced its Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology, designed to connect geographically dispersed data centers into unified AI computing facilities. This new technology aims to address capacity constraints faced by individual data centers, allowing them to function as a single system despite being located in different regions. Stifel raised its price target for Nvidia to $212 from $202, maintaining a Buy rating. The firm anticipates Nvidia to exceed expectations and raise its guidance, citing resumed H20 shipments and increasing demand for GB300 infrastructure. Evercore ISI also increased its price target for Nvidia to $214 from $190, maintaining an Outperform rating. The firm noted Nvidia‚Äôs current trading valuation relative to its historical median and compared it to peers like¬†[AMD](https://www.investing.com/equities/adv-micro-device)¬†and¬†[Broadcom](https://www.investing.com/equities/avago-technologies). Additionally, Bernstein upgraded¬†[Ibiden](https://www.investing.com/equities/ibiden-co-ltd)¬†to Outperform, highlighting its potential as a significant beneficiary of growth in AI chip substrates used in Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs.

Jerome Powell‚Äôs Jackson Hole comments lifted odds of a September cut to 85%, sending the Dow to record highs and fueling Friday‚Äôs rally. Against that backdrop, Nvidia‚Äôs Wednesday earnings are the week‚Äôs main event: Wall Street expects $1.01 EPS on $46.13B in revenue, with analysts noting China licensing uncertainty could soften guidance.

2025-08-23,Nvidia Is Making a New Chip for China Amid Debate on AI Exports,"

Weeks after Nvidia struck a deal with the Trump administration to pay for clearance to ship semiconductors to China, the company has started winding down production of a chip designed for Chinese companies and begun work on its more powerful successor.

Jensen Huang, Nvidia‚Äôs chief executive, said on Friday in Taipei, Taiwan, that the company was offering a ‚Äúnew product for A.I. data centers,‚Äù which would be a version of its most cutting-edge chips that would be modified to reduce some of its performance, as required by the United States. He said he was seeking the Trump administration‚Äôs approval to sell the chip.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to, of course, the United States government,‚Äù Mr. Huang said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre in dialogue with them, but it‚Äôs too soon to know.‚Äù

Mr. Huang‚Äôs comments came as Nvidia asked suppliers to wind down production of its current chip designed for China, the H20, said two people familiar with the company‚Äôs strategy. Beijing has discouraged Chinese companies from buying the H20 chips, with administrators warning that the chips could have ‚Äú[backdoor security risks.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/business/china-nvidia-h20-chips.html)‚Äù

‚ÄúWe constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions,‚Äù said Mylene Mangalindan, an Nvidia spokeswoman.

The Information previously reported on Nvidia‚Äôs winding down production of its H20 chip.

Nvidia‚Äôs plans for China have divided Washington, where the Trump administration and some congressional leaders are at odds over global A.I. chip sales. Because the chips are used to build artificial intelligence systems, the U.S. government has weighed whether to limit sales so that U.S. companies can stay ahead of China in the A.I. race, preventing the Chinese military from using them to coordinate attacks or develop weapons.

In April, Mr. Trump blocked sales of the H20 to China, but reversed that decision in July and later struck a deal to take a 15 percent cut of sales of the chips. Last week, Mr. Trump said he was open to cutting a deal to permit Nvidia to sell a successor to the H20, provided it was ‚Äúsomewhat enhanced ‚Äî in a negative way.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn other words, take 30 percent to 50 percent off of it,‚Äù Mr. Trump said.

A chip that is 50 percent less powerful than the company‚Äôs Blackwell B300 chip would still have better performance than the chips that companies like OpenAI used to train chatbots as recently as last year, according to Lennart Heim, an information scientist at RAND, the think tank. It would exceed the performance thresholds set by the Biden administration for chips sold to China.

Some congressional leaders have criticized the Trump administration‚Äôs policy change and expressed alarm that Mr. Trump would approve selling a more powerful chip than the H20.

# On Friday, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois on the House Select Committee for China,¬†[introduced a bill](https://democrats-selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/krishn_057_xml.pdf)¬†to require presidential and congressional approval of A.I. chips for China. Senator Jim Banks, Republican of Indiana, has also questioned Mr. Huang‚Äôs push to sell chips to China.

Nvidia faces separate challenges in Beijing. In July, China‚Äôs internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, said it had¬†[summoned Nvidia to explain ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù functions](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/business/china-nvidia-h20-chips.html)¬†that would allow the chips to be tracked or shut down remotely. The regulator cited information ‚Äúrevealed by U.S. artificial intelligence experts.‚Äù

China has stepped up its pressure on Nvidia as Chinese media has reported that Huawei, the country‚Äôs tech giant, has improved the capabilities of its own chips. On Thursday,¬†[South China Morning Post reported](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3322688/tech-war-deepseek-hints-china-close-unveiling-home-grown-next-generation-ai-chips?module=top_story&pgtype=section)¬†that DeepSeek, China‚Äôs leading A.I. company, said the country would soon have a next-generation A.I. chip.

Mr. Huang‚Äôs travel schedule testifies to the geopolitical tightrope his company is walking. He is scheduled to travel from Asia, where he is visiting suppliers this week, to Washington, where he has meetings on Monday.

On Friday in Taipei, Mr. Huang said he was in talks with Chinese officials to ease their concerns about security risks. He said he had made ‚Äúvery clear‚Äù to Chinese officials that Nvidia‚Äôs A.I. chips had no security back doors.

‚ÄúThere are no such things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere never has been. And so hopefully, the response that we‚Äôve given to the Chinese government will be sufficient.‚Äù

Mr. Huang added that he was ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù by the questions, given Beijing‚Äôs eagerness to acquire the chips for advanced A.I systems.

‚ÄúAs you know, they requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20 for some time, and I worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHopefully this will be resolved.‚Äù

The pause comes just weeks after Beijing advised domestic firms to stop buying the H20, citing security concerns. 

The chip‚Äôs rollout has already been tangled in U.S. politics ‚Äî first banned in April, then cleared in June after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Trump, but no export licenses have actually been issued. On Aug. 11, Trump confirmed Nvidia and AMD would pay 15% of their China chip revenue to the U.S. government in exchange for licenses, but the deal hasn‚Äôt eased uncertainty. 

With Q2 earnings due Aug. 27, investors will be watching how the halt and regulatory headwinds shape Nvidia‚Äôs guidance."

2025-08-21,Beijing turns against Nvidia‚Äôs AI chip after ‚Äòinsulting‚Äô Lutnick remarks,"Beijing has moved to restrict sales of Nvidia‚Äôs China-specific H20 artificial intelligence processor after US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made remarks on chip exports that senior Chinese officials deemed ‚Äúinsulting,‚Äù according to people with knowledge of the matter. Regulators, including the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), issued informal ‚Äúwindow guidance‚Äù instructing major tech firms such as ByteDance and Alibaba to halt or avoid new H20 orders, citing security and self-sufficiency concerns.

The guidance came just weeks after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang‚Äôs Beijing visit, during which he reaffirmed commitment to the market and saw sufficient client interest to restart H20 production with TSMC. However, some Chinese companies have delayed purchases to wait for the potential release of the Blackwell chip, while certain policymakers are pressing for a broader ban on foreign chips for inference, the largest segment of AI demand.

2025-08-12,My Near Term Outlook on NVDA,"To begin, NVDA is a giant. A GPU producer who had alot of prospect in 2015-2020 from the crypto mining demand.

Once mining became too expensive relative to the payout, GPU demand quickly dipped late 2021, early 2022.

Then ChatGPT came on the scene late 2022.

GPUs became essential for the development and deployment of artificial intelligence due to their parallel processing capabilities, which were well-suited for the complex computations required in AI tasks. While CPUs handled sequential tasks, GPUs excelled at performing many simple operations simultaneously, making them ideal for training and running AI models, especially those involving neural networks.

The demand for GPUs soared, as NVDA owned approximately 90% of this market‚Äôs domain.

Year over year, the total earnings per share outdid its previous by staggering percentages since 2023, which accounts for the dramatic growth of NVDA‚Äôs stock price of approximately 1500%.

NVDA is now the biggest company in the world by measure of market capitalization.

This is a fantastic growth which is much deserved- to an extent.

My concern for the valuation of this stock is the fact that many current share holders of the company don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre buying.

I‚Äôve been seeing comments like ‚ÄúNVDA is going to $500 by the end of the year!!!‚Äù Or ‚Äú$10 trillion market cap incoming‚Äù and I am highly concerned that these retail investors believe comments like this.

And, to be quite frank, I don‚Äôt really believe many current investors (not everyone, of course) of the company really understand how a stock is priced?

To give you the quickest run down of what NVDA‚Äôs current valuation means:

The current forward PE (price to earnings) ratio of the stock is about 42. The highest it‚Äôs ever been. Meaning, the market is pricing in one of two things:

1.	‚Å†42 years of consistent forward earnings, which is approximately $4.31 currently estimated
2.	‚Å†Enough earnings growth on a percentage basis to bring that P/E down to appropriate risk-on tech values like 20-25 P/E in the next few years.

Now, without even going into understanding discount cash flow models, or summative enterprise values, I hope the reader can start to see how difficult of a horizon NVDA has to achieve its current valuation goals.

Earnings growth is going to be a given. Year over year earnings have expanded dramatically for the last 3 years. No worries about that. But it‚Äôs just the TIMING of how fast earnings grow. As of now, the logarithmic growth of earnings is slowing down- and that‚Äôs not a good thing for valuations.

With the current price, the market is pretty much saying that this stock is still supposed to be in exponential growth phase, which it is obviously not anymore.  It‚Äôs accrued as much value as appropriate for current market conditions. 4.5 trillion dollars is a hefty sum, putting it above tech giants like Apple and MSFT who have justified their market capitalization with decades of product line expansion and consistent earnings growth.

This is also to say that these other tech giants have faced a plethora of competition, and still continues to innovate. NVDA, as of now has literally no competition. It‚Äôs priced to perfection, and it‚Äôs priced many many years ahead of time.

NVDA has run too far too fast. And the pullback it will be dramatic.

But that‚Äôs not all I‚Äôm worried about. It currently comprised 15% of the Nasdaq, and about 8% of the SP500.

Not to mention, the growth of algo bots integrating into driving market movement/momentums has really FORCED the upper bounds of these valuations given that these bots are not geared to find RATIONAL investments, rather, make money at the margin by following retail flows and pushing them at an exacerbated scale

If you‚Äôve taken any class in technology and innovation, or even an evolutionary biology class, you will know that it is INEVITABLE for NVDA to eventually gain competition. The market share NVDA currently has on GPUs will be diminished.

I want to emphasize that I truly do believe in NVDA‚Äôs potential as a company and the fact that it will be a giant for years to come.

But as of the short term prospect, the price of the stock is much too high for any investable value

2025-08-11,"NVDA and AMD to pay 15% of China chip sales revenue to US government. This is not as big a negative as you might think, it's just the price they have to pay for predictable revenues from this massive geographical market. Full thoughts:","NVDA barely down in overnight and it makes sense to me. Any potential sell off in NVDA off this news would likely be a short term buying opportunity.¬†

Ultimately, yes, they will have to pay 15% of chip sales to the US government, but this was a market that was blocked off to them not so long ago. The fact that this massive total addressable market is now available to them, in my view, more than offsets any loss of revenue. This is an absolutely massive market for them, and even 85% of the revenue they will generate from this market is still enormous, especially considering the market was closed to them before.

We will get more insight into just how big this market is in their next earnings call.¬†

The 15% revenue share is ultimately just the price that has to be paid in order to have certainty around this massive market opportunity. The interests of NVDA and the US government are aligned here, hence there should be far less disruption going forward.¬†

In my opinion, in a weird way, it';s almost a good thing. It helps us to price in more predictable revenues for NVDA, and it will be an enormous revenue boost, regardless of the fact that they have to give the US government 15% of that.¬†"

Something that¬†**China**¬†does, not the United States of America. Requiring a publicly listed company to share¬†**revenue**¬†from¬†**sales**¬†with the state is a slippery slope. What's next, State owned enterprises?

The good: This does provide more certainty to investors and chipmakers worrying about export bans. The price and terms are set and now chip makers can access China and predict revenues more consistently. 85% revenue from china sales is better than 0%

From a 10,000 foot view, this is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It allows US chipmakers to export AI infra and dictate terms. The alternative would be no sales to China, potentially opening the door for China to get a leg up in the AI race and exporting their AI infra to the world.

2025-08-09,Q3 Guidance is Out of Hand,"TLDR‚Äî
Q3 expectations up from license news
Q3 already expected China rebound
New expectations are lofty
‚ÄúWeak‚Äù guidance if any challenges
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Current estimates for Q3 guidance are averaging $52.5 billion, up from $51.5 a week ago (license news). 

The issue is $51.5 billion already accounted for a rebound in China, and based on napkin math analysts are looking for $47 billion to come from data centers in Q3. 

In Q1, data center revenue was less than $40 billion, impacted by loss of access to China. Q2 will not have any China sales and is expected to be around $41.5-$42.0 billion. 

Analysts expect a snap back to ~$47 billion in Q3 which basically implies absolutely no China headwinds. 

AMD, while reporting earlier than NVDA, explicitly said they were not counting China revenue in Q3 for data center guidance. 

Even though investors are highly confident the licenses are coming, this new Q3 guide expects a flawless rebound. 

I‚Äôm closer to $51-51.5 billion for Q3‚Äôs guide, and a guidance miss while the stock is up 30% since last report could spell trouble. "

The timing feels significant - not just another AI earnings run but potential policy shifts that could reshape the whole sector landscape. I've been watching this play out on various platforms including Tiger, and the institutional sentiment seems to be shifting toward viewing semiconductors as a legitimate 10-20 year structural theme rather than just a cyclical trade. The combination of AI infrastructure demand plus possible tariff relief could be setting up something bigger than the typical tech rally. Anyone else thinking this might be the beginning of a longer semiconductor supercycle, or are we getting ahead of ourselves here?"

2025-08-08,CAPEX resilience through significant macro-economic downturns,"I, like many folks, can read the anecdotal signs that the economy is hanging on by a thread. However, I believe there may be some reason to expect NVDA's performance through that to be better than many other stocks and that we won't see a collapse like we saw in in 2022.

I asked ChatGPT5 to evaluate the resilience of large corporate AI infrastructure CAPEX through a major economic downturn or even stagflation scenario. 

Edit: I tried to post the entire ChatGPT response, which is super interesting, but Reddit auto-filters.  So let's see if the summary works.

>If the economy tips into a strong recession, the Big Four (AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, META) will keep spending heavily on AI infrastructure, because (1) the game is strategic and cumulative; (2) they have financing options that most firms lack; and (3) customer demand is increasingly usage-based, giving them line-of-sight to monetize capacity. You should expect timing tweaks, more creative power procurement, and region/workload reprioritization, not wholesale cuts. In a stagflation outcome, capex still persists but becomes more power-constrained, cost-disciplined, and selective, and more projects slip right due to power and cost friction. Outside of hyperscalers, AI capex gets hit‚Äîmost will rent compute or wait."

2025-08-03,NVDA Q3 Guidance: A Billion Dollar Question,"NVDA is set to report its Q2 earnings on August 27th, 2025. While estimates for the current quarter (green) are somewhat muted due to the temporary China ban, analysts are hopeful for meaningful re-aceleration in Q3 (purple).

https://preview.redd.it/0n6u0raxsogf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed6ec2ae25b1b268e1c3751e3447cd9aee1e9b70

The current forecasts for Q2 and Q3 revenue are $45.55 billion and $51.5 billion, respectively, with QoQ growth slowing to just over 3% in Q2 and surging back to over 13% in Q3. Analysts are hopeful the company will restart generating revenue in China in Q3, but are not forecasting a full quarter of uninterrupted revenue.¬† Let‚Äôs not forget that on last quarter‚Äôs call, the company stated guidance for this quarter was negatively impacted by $8 billion, meaning $53 billion instead of around $45 billion this quarter. That‚Äôs the difference between low single-digit growth and over 20% QoQ growth without interruption.

https://preview.redd.it/cyopxrg4togf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8da890197c953cf658120d7f0b1768b5b421275e

When refocusing from QoQ to YoY, the estimates call for YoY growth to drop below 50% in Q3, even with the meaningful jump from Q2 to Q3. It seems the quarters of 50% annual growth are behind NVDA, as comps get tougher, and the guide for Q3 would need to be closer to that cursed $53 billion number to maintain the 50% story.

https://preview.redd.it/c9z9otbbtogf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a141799f4d13e74dbc1dd43ce773d207dac253f7

  
I‚Äôm looking for just north of $46 billion this quarter, which would represent closer to 5% QoQ growth. In terms of guidance, though, NVDA still does not have these licenses that the market is so sure it will acquire. China is still too large a market to be locked out of, and while Huang is a great leader, mixed signals with regulations and tariffs may weigh on the flexibility of the company short term.¬†

I think NVDA needs to guide for $52 billion or higher to firmly ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the analyst consensus and assuage growth fears. However, I think guidance will come in closer to $51 billion, and I worry the market may not appreciate that missing billion dollars.¬†

2025-07-31,New investor,"Hello,
I have around $1,000 saved up and I want to start investing in Nvidia. Should I go all-in on the stock now, or buy a few shares and spread the rest across other stocks? I strongly believe AI has a lot of potential in the future. What would you recommend?

I also plan to dollar-cost average (DCA) into my portfolio every month "
2025-07-31,today is the day sistas,"Remember last earning call sistas? It was crazy, so let them have their after-hours fun today, and over the weekend, before the opening bell, it's time to take profits, who agrees with me?"
2025-07-31,Can someone explain the obsession with AMD?,"Now... I remember being on the NVDA board and you had people coming over here or to r/NVDA and just...trolling when it was at 300 a share, at 400 a share it was over-valued. Hell, I remember people talking shit when it went down \~60%.

  
I always thought that was weird. Why are you treating this like team sports? This is INVESTMENTS. 

I've been LONG in NVDA and when I went in, I put everything I had into it. I sold a rental property to buy shares in 2019/2020 when it was about 230 a share, I bought 1500 shares. I watched it split and grow. I sold more properties over the next two years and in Sept of '23, I bought another 1000 shares. 

My point is ONLY to say.... I love Nvidia and Jensen Huang as much as anyone... who is investing should.   
  
But now there are all these threads about how ""AMD fan boys think..."" or taking what people are saying and twisting it and shitting on AMD as an investment. 

  
What's the thesis for NVDA? AI Capex could reach 1T per annum by 2030. 

AMD is a \~270B company. NVDA is a \~4.5T company. 

If you want to JUST buy Nvidia, that's great. Please buy and hold. It's a fantastic investment and I think you're going to beat the market.  
  
But AMD has gotten massive investments themselves. The Saudi Arabia and UAE announcements were BOTH NVDA and AMD.    
  
AMD guided for 7.1B to 7.8B for next Quarter. So what do you think is going to happen when Qatar and Saudi Arabia both invest 10B into AMD's GPUs, META, GOOGL, AMZN, they ALL use AMD as well. 

So... is NVDA by FAR the most dominant company? Fuck yes it is.   
  
But if you're ONLY investing in NVDA and ignoring the rest of the market... I think you're really missing out... but that's fine, that's your decision. I just don't get why there are so many threads about AMD and how they're so far behind NVDA. They don't NEED to catch NVDA. They just need to pick up the scraps.

  
They're projecting 1T CapEx for GPUs by 2030. That's not ALL going to Nvidia and AMD has a much easier time seeing a 200-300% improve over the next 5 years than NVDA does. That'd put AMD at \~1T and NVDA at 13T.  
Also, AVGO, SMCI, TSM... these are all GREAT investments.



I'll catch a lot of shit for this, but I'm not telling anyone to go out and sell NVDA. I'm certainly not. I AM saying AMD has a lot of upside, AVGO has been incredible. I think SMCI would be \~120 if they were run better and there were less concerns about their management. 

  
Anyway, the point, it's not a team sport. Try and be objective. The whole point is to retire early or retire comfortable, to be able to take care of your family. Not root for NVDA like you're a fan of just one company and you're too loyal to that company to look at other competitors. "

2025-07-31,The Cyberspace Administration of China holds talks with NVIDIA over security risks related to backdoors in H20 computing chip vulnerabilities.,"Recently, it was revealed that NVIDIA's computing chips have serious security issues. Earlier, a US congress called for advanced chips exported by the US to be equipped with a ""tracking and locating"" function. Experts in the US artificial intelligence field disclosed that NVIDIA's computing chip technology for ""tracking and locating"" and ""remote shutdown"" is mature. To safeguard the cybersecurity and data security of Chinese users, in accordance with relevant provisions of the Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law, and Personal Information Protection Law, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) summoned NVIDIA on July 31, 2025, demanding that NVIDIA explain the security risks associated with backdoors in its H20 computing chips sold to China and submit relevant supporting materials.

Woot... Woot

I believed in Nvidia, once I got know what they were actually doing in terms of AI. I always knew they have state of the art products, even pre-ordered some jetson nanos and other products. 
I don't think so I've ever liked a company this much. It's pretty awesome.

Now that's its in gains, it feels good. Red days were hell, but they have some deep life lessons which I don't think so I'll ever forget, also this is a company which I think I'll always remember.

Anyways, guess when did I buy, right before deepseek, I was amazed to markets reaction and just wished had more money to double down but I was in deepshit due to deepseek. That day is still blurry.

Nvidia dropped into the $80s. Robinhood fired off a margin call notice. My options got obliterated. I don‚Äôt even remember how I stayed above water. Maybe I had a random put, maybe just dumb luck, somehow stayed afloat. I was mentally wrecked, and fckng high all the time then but what I didn't do was sell the shares: And damn, I‚Äôm thankful for that.

Then came the tariffs. BS Liberation day. Then that $5bn surcharge, for what??? Wish had more monies to buy then again. Honestly, after deepseek, tariffs didn't bother, infact helped me buy other investments. 

Options trading is your choice, but even if you are buying a put, invest in this company by buying shares. So my regard math is saying the cost price is too damn high from the average price. Let's meet in the middle. I don't give a shit if the share price goes lower, I'm going to keep buying.

2025-07-30,Why NVDA hits $200 before AMD (both trading ~$175),"Been in semis since the dot-com crash, survived through Intel's dominance, AMD's Ryzen comeback, and now this AI madness. Currently holding 450 shares of NVDA at $142 average, so yeah I'm biased but hear me out.

NVDA isn't just another chip company anymore - they literally built the highway everyone else has to drive on. My buddy works at a mid-size AI startup and they evaluated AMD's new MI350 cards last month. On paper? Amazing. 288GB memory vs NVDA's 180GB, better price per FLOP, all that good stuff. Guess what they went with? NVDA. Why? Because rewriting 2 years of CUDA code would take their team 6 months minimum.

That's the thing everyone misses. It's not about having the fastest chip anymore (though NVDA's still competitive). It's about ecosystem lock-in. When every AI tutorial on YouTube uses CUDA, when every university teaches CUDA, when every developer's resume mentions CUDA experience - good luck convincing companies to switch.

I watched this same playbook with Microsoft in the 90s. Didn't matter if Linux was technically better, everyone was already locked into Windows. CUDA is NVDA's Windows moment.

The hyperscaler spending is insane too. Microsoft just announced they're spending like $80B on capex this year. Where's that going? Not to AMD, I can tell you that much. When your customers (Netflix, OpenAI, etc.) are all optimized for NVDA hardware, you buy NVDA hardware. It's that simple.

AMD makes solid chips, don't get me wrong. I actually held some AMD during their CPU comeback and made decent money. But this AI race is different. Enterprise customers don't want to be guinea pigs when they're spending millions on infrastructure.

The numbers don't lie either - NVDA's been beating estimates consistently while AMD's datacenter revenue is still trying to find its footing. Wall Street loves predictability, and right now NVDA is the definition of predictable growth.

My PT is $220 by year-end, but honestly $200 feels like a layup at this point. Holding through earnings next month too - their guidance has been conservative lately and I'm betting on another beat.

Anyone else loading up before the next run or am I being too optimistic here?"

While I appreciate the callout for the purposes of precaution, I think I ultimately disagree that the two are exactly comparable.

If anything, I think what we‚Äôre seeing with AI is likely more comparable to the Automobile revolution ‚Äî something that changed lives as we know it.

The Dot Com Bubble was just an oversupply of online companies that didn‚Äôt have a demand to reciprocate them.

Meanwhile, companies are integrating AI into so many different areas of their business and they‚Äôre just getting started, and I only seeing this adoption going in one direction.

2025-07-29,"NVDA - Many are probably under appreciating just how big the h20 reopening is for them. Here's my analysis, referencing Jefferies research and Bernstein's research to corroborate my view.","AMD yesterday raised the price of their MI350 chips, from $10K to $25K as they look to challenge NVIDIA. HSBC claims yesterday that they believe AMD can genuinely compete with NVIDIA's Blackwell Chips, as they lifted AMD's 2025 AI revenue forecast from $9.6B to $15.1B.¬†

For that reason, coupled with the strength of AMD's price action, AMD does still look interesting but I think that many forget just how much of a beast Nvidia is. And actually, just how significant this H20 news that Trump announced last week is.¬†

Jeffries for instance, said in an analyst note that Nvidia's H20 chip supply will not be able to match China's soaring demand.¬†

They argued that Nvidia‚Äôs H20 AI chip stockpile (600K‚Äì900K units) falls short of China‚Äôs demand, which could hit 1.8M units, following a temporary easing of U.S. export restrictions.Despite supply limits, Chinese firms prefer Nvidia chips due to its CUDA ecosystem, superior performance, and limited local alternatives.

So whilst there are alternative chips, the Chinese generally favour Nvidia's chips. With China's AI capex forecasted to be $108B, there is absolutely no signs of AI demand cooling in China, and this is a MASSIVE tailwind for Nvidia that they once again have access to.¬†

And we have clear signs of just how big this ramp in H20 production will be now with the China market reopened. Just today, nvidia ordered 300,000 H20 chips from TSM, adding 600k-700k in inventory.¬†

Bernstein is expecting that Nvidia will hold 54% of the China market after their H20 approval.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/rmle7swopsff1.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2c5a096e23506ac103e31b47a00d06c0af04063

The next biggest, Huawei will have just 28%. For comparison and context, they expect that AMD will hold just 4% of the Chinese market.¬†

So nvidia is absolutely the leader here. and I think many do forget just how big of a deal the H20 to China resumption is.¬†

Breakout to new highs.¬†

2025-07-15,Nvidia's share price hits $4 trillion CEO sells his shares,"NVIDIA's revenue growth and technological leadership remain strong, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence and data centres. Despite high valuation ratios, this continues to fuel investor enthusiasm.

CEO Jensen Huang's recent stock sale was routine and pre-planned, and does not indicate a loss of confidence, as he retains a significant ownership stake.

Key risks include slowing profit growth, intensifying competition, custom chip development for major clients, and geopolitical tensions affecting inventory and sales.

Although Nvidia's current stock price is not cheap, given its innovation and financial strength, I expect NVDA's stock price to rise further, despite narrowing profit margins.

Intel is a fierce competitor of NVIDIA, and the company has recently reported poor earnings. Meanwhile, NVIDIA has seen strong sales growth, with its market capitalisation recently reaching $4 trillion, far surpassing other Wall Street darlings. Meanwhile, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang is selling some of his shares. However, this sale is largely symbolic, as Huang still holds a significant stake in NVIDIA. Nevertheless, the company's massive market capitalisation has sparked questions about whether it is truly worth that much.

Despite strong fundamentals and ample cash reserves, Nvidia has been facing the issue of slowing profit growth for some time. Nvidia's stock price has surged nearly 46%, while the S&P 500 Index (SP500) has risen by only around 10%.

Nvidia Management's Stock Sales

CEO Jensen Huang recently sold $35.5 million worth of Nvidia stock. This move has sparked debate among investors: is it a warning sign that investors are losing confidence in the company's future, or is it just business as usual?

Huang's transactions were executed under a pre-set 10b5-1 rule plan approved in March 2025. This rule allows insiders to automatically sell their shares at a specific price during a predetermined timeframe. This protects their transactions from allegations of insider advantage, as speculative sales could indicate concerns about near-term prospects.

In July, Huang sold 75,000 shares over three consecutive days at prices ranging from $158.43 to $164.47. This reduced the CEO's direct shareholding by just 0.03% to 74.8 million shares. However, Huang's total beneficial shareholding through trusts and entities remains approximately 858 million shares. In my view, this clearly demonstrates the CEO's sustained focus on NVIDIA's prospects.

Market observers also note that even the 190,000 shares sold in June (worth $28.7 million) are insignificant compared to the CEO's holdings of $130 billion (at current prices). This is far from a ‚Äòfire sale‚Äô but aligns with the trend among tech executives to gradually diversify their wealth.

Additionally, we should not forget that these transactions were pre-arranged. If the NVIDIA CEO acted on sudden news, these transactions would have deviated from his plan. Furthermore, the execution price also reflects the pre-set plan.

Meanwhile, these sales do not negate the fact that NVIDIA's current market capitalisation exceeds that of several major U.S. tech giants. Is NVDA stock really worth that much?

Objectively speaking, stock market trends often contradict common sense, classic valuation ratios, and the fact that most companies' growth rates will eventually slow down. In other words, investors will seize every opportunity to increase their holdings of Nvidia stock. Therefore, I fully understand that my scepticism does not mean that Nvidia stock will immediately stop rising. On the contrary, at least if there is no fundamental change in Nvidia's stock fundamentals, shareholders are likely to buy Nvidia stock after each pullback in the near term.

On 28 May 2025, NVIDIA released its first-quarter financial results for the year ending 27 April 2025. During the period, the company reported revenue of $44 billion, up 69% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. The data centre business was the primary driver of revenue growth, with sales reaching $39 billion, up 73% year-over-year due to weak demand. However, I believe that such a significant proportion of growth coming from a single business segment is cause for concern.

Additionally, Nvidia's new Blackwell platform is one of the company's key growth drivers. In the first quarter, Blackwell chips accounted for nearly 70% of data centre sales. Thanks to the company's innovative GB200 NVL system, Nvidia is delivering AI computing at an unprecedented scale and efficiency, enabling the company to achieve the industry's lowest inference token cost.

Furthermore, the networking business is another strong growth catalyst for Nvidia. The business generated $5 billion in quarterly sales, a 64% increase from the previous quarter.

Beyond the data centre sector, NVIDIA has made significant strides in gaming, automotive, and robotics. Gaming revenue reached a record $3.8 billion, up 48% quarter-over-quarter. Meanwhile, automotive sales grew 72% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for autonomous driving and innovative cockpit platforms. NVIDIA's technology is expected to support the next generation of gaming and AI PCs, further enhancing its overall market presence.

A clear downside risk is that the AI gold rush will eventually come to an end, ultimately depressing Nvidia's stock price and dampening investors' overly optimistic expectations. But the key question is when it will end. After all, despite the fact that several U.S. companies that have been in operation since the 1990s rose to prominence during the dot-com bubble while many of their competitors went bankrupt, their market capitalisation now exceeds trillions of dollars. Their survival is primarily due to their financial stability. As I mentioned earlier, NVIDIA is a financially stable company and has achieved significant profit growth.

NVIDIA's sales growth rate has been impressive, but there are concerns that the company's profit growth rate may be slowing. Additionally, due to intensifying competition, particularly in the AI market, profit margins appear to be gradually declining. This is evident from the table below.

In addition, this is the first time that Nvidia's net income has declined from the previous quarter.

Secondly, Nvidia faces competition from custom chips. Large cloud customers are developing their own custom chips (ASICs) to reduce their dependence on Nvidia. Clearly, this could lead to pricing pressure and market share losses for the company.

Furthermore, there are geopolitical risks, the most significant of which are the US-China trade tensions and restrictions on exports of high-power chips to China. As I mentioned earlier, China has a large customer base.

Additionally, due to geopolitical risks, Nvidia's inventory levels have risen significantly. For example, stricter export controls have led to a sharp increase in the price of H20 GPU inventory.

As I have mentioned multiple times before, competition in the AI sector is intensifying. Although NVIDIA dominates the AI accelerator market, other companies, such as AMD and Intel, are also expanding in this field. This could erode NVIDIA's market share.

In terms of valuation ratios, NVDA stock is also expensive.

With the exception of AMD, most of the company's competitors have valuation ratios that are significantly lower than those of Nvidia. Only Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is relatively reasonable, thanks to its outstanding profitability. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio are particularly high. However, some investors may believe that Nvidia's stock price should be higher than its peers due to its growth rate."

2025-07-14,How to Lock in Profits without Closing the Position (Pt. 1),"**Pt. 1 of Titled Write Up, Focused on 100 shares of NVDA. TLDR at bottom.**

After a brief but violent downturn in the US equities markets, the main indexes like the S&P500 and Nasdaq100 have swiftly returned to record highs. Investors were spooked by the current administration‚Äôs aggressive tariff policy and feared a possible global trade war. Tech stocks were hit particularly hard, with stocks like NVDA and META falling over 40 and 30 percent, respectively, from their February peaks. 

Investors who were willing to weather short-term volatility and possibly worsening global trade conditions were rewarded, as most tech stocks have significantly rebounded from April lows (some bouncing harder than others).

On Monday, April 7th, trade and tariff fears were at peak levels, and NVDA opened the day‚Äôs trading session around $88 per share. Investors largely saw this as too cheap, and the surge to around $97 at close marked the beginning of the next wave higher for the stock.

On Monday, July 7th, NVDA opened for trading just shy of $160 per share, and by the end of the week, the company achieved $4T in Market Cap and closed a few cents under $165 per share.

Even without nailing the bottom, any shares purchased during this leg up are well into the green. Data from Webull indicates that traders holding NVDA have an average cost of about $124, and 99.49% of free float shares were purchased below the current price.

Considering that the average investor is up 33% on their position, and that almost any sale of shares would be for the seller‚Äôs profit, many people could be mulling closing their positions just to ‚Äúlock in profits.‚Äù

This should never be the sole reason to sell a position, and this write-up will explain how to achieve that goal without closing out the position using NVDA as an example. It does not matter if the unrealized gain is held in shares or options; each position type still has multiple ways to reduce the potential for loss while maintaining a position in the company.

# Example 1 (Owning 100+ Shares @ $125):

Many investors who have been holding NVDA for a significant period have accumulated at least 100 shares of stock. In this example, an investor owns 100 shares of NVDA at an average price of $125 per share. They spent $12,500 for the shares, and at the time of writing, the shares are worth about $16,500. The shares are over 30% in the green, and with each additional 100 shares owned, the investor is holding another \~$4000 in unrealized gain.

Owning 100 shares of stock gives an investor access to derivatives such as options contracts, where contracts are allocated by lots of 100 shares. The terms ‚ÄúDerivative Securities‚Äù and ‚ÄúOptions Contracts‚Äù can sound complex and difficult to understand, but are simpler than most realize, and their main purpose is to reduce risk for shareholders.

Passive investors might hear ‚Äúcall options‚Äù and immediately think of the GME phenomenon that was largely driven by retail traders buying these contracts and generating almost too good to be true returns when the stock experienced a short squeeze.

However, a derivative is just something whose value depends on the value of something else. In this case, the option contract‚Äôs value is derived from, or depends on, the underlying stock‚Äôs value. Instead of outright selling the shares for $16,500, realizing the gain and exiting the position, the investor can utilize options contracts to sell the obligation of giving up the shares, rather than selling the shares outright.

What this means in practice is that an investor who is willing to sell their shares at $165 can instead sell the $165 strike call option with an expiration date of nearly any Friday in the future. The $165 strike call that expires this upcoming Friday can be sold for about $280, while if the investor believes $165 might be a medium-term top for the stock, yet does not want to sell, they can collect $2900 for selling the $165 strike call expiring in about a year.

(Note: Options Premium, or money used trading an option, is denoted on a per share basis on a lot of 100 shares. ‚Äú$2.8 premium‚Äù = $2.8 dollars per share times 100 shares = $280)

Consider a scenario in which the NVDA investor sells the $165 call option for this Friday and collects $280. The investor‚Äôs cost basis has dropped from $12,500 to $12,220, and they are now obligated to sell their shares at $165 on or before Friday.

If the stock continues its rally next week, the investor is forced to sell the shares at $165, which they were willing to do anyway. They collected $280 and received $16,500 for the sale of the shares, which nets a profit of $4280 after subtracting the $12,500 spent on the shares. In this situation, the investor simply received an extra $280 to sell their shares at a price they wanted

If the stock starts to pull back next week and is below $165 on Friday, the obligation to sell at $165 will not be worth anything since the option buyer could get their shares cheaper on the open market. In this situation, the investor collected $280 and was released from the obligation to sell their shares.

So where‚Äôs the downside? In the situation in which the stock rallies, the downside is that it is impossible to gain more than $4280 on the position. Even if NVDA went to $200 this week, the investor is obligated to sell their shares at $165, and will net the profit from the sale and the collected premium.

In the event the stock falls, selling the $165 call does not fully remove downside risk. If the stock closes the week at $160, the investor lost $5 per share yet only collected $2.8 per share in premium, meaning they saw a decrease in unrealized gain despite collecting $280 and being released of their obligation.

While the investor can sell the $165 call again, it is going to be worth less premium than the $2.8 collected before. This is because the stock is no longer trading around that price, and to collect that amount, the investor would need to consider selling the $160 strike call (similar to how they sold the $165 strike when the stock was worth $165).

Even with the price decrease, the investor could collect about another 100 dollars by selling the $165 call again. If the stock rallies back above $165, the investor will be forced to sell the shares, but will collect $280 and $100 using options contracts in addition to selling for their desired price. However, if the stock continues declining and drops by more than $1 during the week, the $100 in premium will not cover the loss from the shares. This is still beneficial to the investor as collecting that premium drops their cost basis from $12,500 to $12,120 ($125 to $121.2), helping offset the decline in share value and preserving gains from a recovery.

While it is generally not advised to choose a strike price below cost basis, the investor can choose any strike price and expiration date available on the options chain. There is currently someone willing to pay $50 for the right (and the seller‚Äôs obligation) to acquire the option seller‚Äôs shares at $175 by this Friday. The option buyer expects the share price to increase by over 6% by next week, and an investor with 100 shares can take that money in exchange for the obligation to give up the shares at $175 by Friday. If the stock moves above $175 this week, they will sell their shares and receive $17,500 along with the money from the option buyer. If the stock closes the week at $175.00 or lower, the obligation is worthless. Given that the share price is currently below $165, many people may find this an enticing offer.

However, investors might not want to manage the hassle of opening and closing these obligations each week, and frankly $280 is not ‚Äúlocking in profits‚Äù when spending $12,500. How does the investor really ‚Äúlock‚Äù the profit in without selling the position? Near term, the only way to collect enough premium to secure the full $4000 profit is to sell deep ITM calls. This will likely result in the shares getting called away, so it does not accomplish part two of the goal. The two most important factors for an option‚Äôs price are time to expiry and the underlying stock price, so to keep the price constant ($165 call), the investor needs to utilize the value of time.

Consider the second scenario in which the investor collects $2900 by selling the aforementioned $165 call expiring in about one year.

The investor still owns 100 shares at an average cost of $125 per share. The investor has an unrealized gain of $4000 and is weary of a correction over the coming months, but they do not want to sell their shares as they believe the stock will rally again sometime in the future.

Instead of selling now and trying to time a pullback in share price that may never come, the investor decides to reduce their risk by collecting a large amount of premium in exchange for the obligation to sell their shares at their desired price. In this example, the investor collects $29.00 premium or $2900 and is now obligated to sell their shares at $165 any time within the next year.

Before going into the situation outcomes, it is important to note the full effect this option sale has on the stock position. Initially, the shares were acquired for $12,500 but the investor just received $2900 from the option contract sale. The Investor has now reduced their exposure from $12,500 to $9,600 which equates to an average cost of $96 per share. However, this also means the position will move differently than holding 100 shares.

When an investor owns 100 shares, a $1 move in the stock price will net a gain or loss of $100 on the position, which is intuitive. Adding an option contract into the mix complicates the movement for several reasons. The main reason is that the option contract has a delta between 0.00 and 1.00.

An option‚Äôs delta can tell an investor many things about that derivative, such as the probability that the option expires in the money and the amount of shares controlled. There are plenty of online resources to learn more about delta and option greeks, but for this article, the purpose of delta will be to illustrate effective control of shares.

While this might sound confusing, consider the 100 shares of stock. A share of stock is 0.01 delta, meaning 100 shares is 1.00 delta. Options that are deep in the money have a delta near 1.00 and signal that the option moves similarly to owning 100 shares (both equaling 1.00 delta).

So now, considering the $165 call expiring in one year, the delta is about 0.63. This means it moves similarly to owning 63 shares of stock. If an investor sells this option, that is the equivalent of shorting 63 shares. While the delta of a share is always equal to 0.01, and 100 shares will always be 1.00 delta, the delta of an options contract changes as the stock price changes. Since options delta describes how likely it is that the option expires in the money, a sharp decline in share price would reduce the likelihood of expiring above $165 and therefore decrease the delta and the options premium.

The investor‚Äôs position can now be summarized like this: The Investor has $9,600 of exposure and sees similar movement to owning 37 shares of stock. The investor is obligated to sell their shares for $16,500 at any point in the next year. If the option expires worthless, the investor keeps the premium and the shares, while if the option expires in the money, the shares will be sold for $16,500 and the investor keeps the $2900 from the option sale.

The same downsides mentioned earlier apply to this position. If NVDA continues its rocket-fueled rally over the next year, the investor has capped their gain to $6900 ($4000 from share sale and $2900 from option sale). It is worth noting that generating $6900 profit on $12,500 is over 50% gain, and it is also worth noting $6900 profit using this strategy is similar to selling 100 shares at $194.

If the stock starts to fall, the investor still has multiple choices available to them. Options can be bought and sold at any time until expiration, so if the value of the option drops significantly, the investor may want to use the $2900 originally collected to close out the obligation early, while still netting a gain on the option sale and reurchase. The investor is then back to only owning 100 shares, and can repeat the process. The investor can also choose to hold the option to expiry, where the only two outcomes are either a $6900 gain or a reduction in cost basis to $96/share.

Even though selling call options limits the amount of gain for the investor, it significantly reduces exposure to near-term corrections or sudden crashes like the markets saw earlier this year. Cautious investors sitting on sizable unrealized gains may want to consider using the sale of options to reduce exposure while markets are volatile and less certain. ‚ÄúLocking in profits‚Äù using options is a spectrum, and investors should consider their personal goals before participating in this strategy. Option holders have not been forgotten, as part 2 will explain how to achieve this same goal in a slightly different way. Thank you for reading this far.

Disclaimer: Options are not suitable for all investors, may not be available in all accounts, and should not be used as anything other than a tool to reduce risk. I am not a Financial Advisor, and this is not financial advice.

**TLDR: Locking in profit is a spectrum, use covered calls to reduce exposure and collect premium based on personal objectives**

Although Nvidia is at all time highs and it the largest company in the world, we think this is just the beginning of the AI race, and with global adoption across the world coming, Nvidia has positioned themselves for success."

Shut out of China

Competitors on their heals (1-2 years behind and no way to catch the unsung absolute genius of Jensen Huang, even with 10,000 of China‚Äôs greatest engineers working on it in a collaborative basis‚Ä¶.because Communism and Socialism DO NOT WORK)

Reverse engineering efforts: how do you reverse engineer the 208,000,000,000 transistors on a Blackwell chip, and the CUDA infrastructure in which those chips work and interact?

 Tariffs? Jensen and Taiwan Semi are both cooperating with the current administration and building plants in America. Trumps ire is currently focused on Apple not building iPhones in the US. No one knows the future, but things look good for NVDA right now.

The short seller billionaire crowd have run out of ammo. I would wager they all own some NVDA long now. Failure to capitulate to NVDA‚Äôs dominance is likely lost opportunity."
