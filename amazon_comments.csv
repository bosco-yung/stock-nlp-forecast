2025-10-19,# Holding when stocks are up is diamond hands; holding when they're down is bag holding
2025-10-19,If you guys listened to the corporate amzn folks who regularly tell you guys to not buy in you wouldnt b in this position lol
2025-10-19,you guys are trolling at this point for rage lol because there's no way you are real investors with these childish posts
2025-10-19,"Proudly holding 1/20,000,000 of the company ✊and to be honest I think it’s a pretty funny joke"
2025-10-19,"You’re just a troll man. A real shareholder follows the stock, not  with emotion but with calculation. This can’t be real bro"
2025-10-18,I make option plays every week on AMZN both long and short. It's been working for months.
2025-10-19,"You could also sell calls if you own enough shares. Or better yet, keep buying up the dip."
2025-10-18,"amazon has seasonal investments in their own company. people thinking they wont go up from rsi in january again, are just not putting in effort into research. we will see an ath soon."
2025-10-18,"Goddamn the mitigated gall to ponder whether bill ackman learned his lesson.


Yes you make a fantastic case for Amazon I want to buy and hold forever."
2025-10-18,"I worked for them for 5 years and have a personal axe to grind, since although my performance evals were near perfect every time, my pay raises were a joke and were weighted more with RSUs. So after working my ass off I own 800 shares of Amazon stock that have negative returns ytd."
2025-10-19,Bought 3000 shares on Friday at 213.82
2025-10-19,"You're right, but your timing is off. Jeff Bezos and his ex-wife are net sellers rather than being involved in a significant buyback. Instead, we are witnessing a massive sell-off. MacKenzie Scott: ~US$12.6 billion


Jeff Bezos: ~US$5.7 billion


Total combined ≈ US$18.3 billion"
2025-10-18,"Google had an actual reason to not grow, AI hype really made investors doubt if Google Search was death sentenced, but they showed that they are not only a search engine company."
2025-10-19,When u gona sell some ?
2025-10-19,Sell covered calls on them
2025-10-18,"If you put it like that amazon has actual reason as well, cloud growth of only 17% last quarter plus the margins pressures. Anyway the ceo explained that the margins are due to depreciations and that the demand is higher than the capacity. I believe if the margins was not the case and if the explanation has been put better amazon current price would have been 250-60."
2025-10-19,Amazon’s reason for not growing (the stock price) was that they saved everyone during COVID and we thanked them by pulling valuation forward. But the fundamentals have grown like sweet sweet exponential clockwork
2025-10-19,Definitely- at the start of this year i had just retired from Amazon and assumed their stock would at least keep pace with the S&P 500.
2025-10-19,"I’ll hold and see if they ever go up by some year, rather than paying capital gains tax, since the share price is still above my cost basis."
2025-10-18,"Your the worlds unsung hero, out here fixing spelling on reddit"
2025-10-19,I think Cook and Jassy have lots in common. Neither are as good at their jobs as their predecessors.
2025-10-18,AAPL is way behind on the AI race (some could argue they didn’t even really enter) and loosing their AI talents to Meta yet they pumped 2% today. The problem is they’re not giving anything that starts any positive momentum so even on green days they’ve got nothing
2025-10-19,I keep adding AMZN and GOOG. The two companies now make up roughly 50% of my portfolio. I’ll keep holding and adding to these companies as long as the fundamentals don’t change.
2025-10-18,I just went all in AMZN and plan to hold for 12+ months.  Joined the sub yesterday and damn it's depressing around here lol.
2025-10-19,You are already doing good and above average history market return.
2025-10-19,€191=$223
2025-10-17,"I am even out of money to buy the dip to reduce costs. Please one catalyst, so that it goes back to 225 and I can sell it off"
2025-10-18,Everything green except amzn today
2025-10-18,"Yeah I had a crush on Jeff bezos, but ever since he left for milk in 2021, Amazon has never been the same… we could really use another bald ceo right now 😢"
2025-10-17,6th straight week of red. Surely its gotta be green soon so I can breakeven and never go near this horse shit again
2025-10-18,"Yall are some cry babies. I’ve been accumulating Amzn since before the last split a few years ago. But yall aren’t old enough to remember that cuz you were still sucking on your mommas titties.

If you are playing games with stocks don’t invest in Amazon, but if you see the potential and are a long term investor, this stock is FIRE."
2025-10-18,"Holding until earnings and then dumping, whether it goes up or down. It’s a good stock in the long run, but every dollar I’ve had in it has been a missed opportunity so far."
2025-10-18,My cost basis is $203.  65k worth.  It's about 8% of my portfolio. Should I get out now and invest in something else?  The thing barely moves while everything else is doing well.
2025-10-18,I feel like that is just waiting for earnings to rally. I’ve seen stocks before get battered for no real reason and pump on earnings regardless of the results of them. Just my thoughts.
2025-10-19,Am i the only one under $100 average on this stock in this sub? This stock rules lol loving my 2x. Not selling unless the game changes
2025-10-18,"I'm never buying it again. But.... I will continue to trade options around it, likely for a long time. I'm up about 30% as of last week, and I only bought in at the $207 level more or less. Selling both calls and puts and judt endlessly rolling them has been a decent money generator. I actually hope it doesn't move up too fast. Steady is ok but volatile moves will add some tricky moves if they're super strong."
2025-10-18,Entry point matters. I finally bought a bunch of AMZN shares for the first time when it went below $100 in 2023. Today I sold some AMZN shares to buy more APLD shares. I believe APLD has a lot more room to grow than AMZN. Time will tell.
2025-10-17,This thinking is what got us all bagholding in the first place
2025-10-18,6 red weeks in a row. Just another day as an amzn bagholder
2025-10-18,Green Day AMZN 📉 Red Day AMZN 📉
2025-10-17,I am not selling even if it goes to 100 - this is for wall street. Fuck you
2025-10-17,"I read on news that Jeff's ex wife been cashing out billions out of amzn this yr. 

I wonder if that's why this stock has done poorly"
2025-10-17,"Hey at least it's doing better than LULU, a shit stock that was hyped non stop on reddit"
2025-10-18,You stfu. You're clearly losing money. Even Warren Buffet only buying UNH and Nucor when the stock prices went down to attractive levels this year. 
2025-10-17,I dont get this sub it just makes it a good time to accumulate more. Stop being so pestinmistc look at the 10 year graph its bound to outperfrom again
2025-10-17,At this rate < $200 before earnings next week . Any bets ?
2025-10-18,It’s only a loss when you sell. But I just bought some ELF
2025-10-17,"Its going to go below 210 today, and below 200 next week. I fucking hate this stock with so much passion. -4% YTD. While every other mag7 is +20%. As a shareholder, I feel like im getting spit-roasted."
2025-10-17,Started selling. Such a waste of money
2025-10-18,"The majority of retail investors are way too reactive and don't see the long term only the day to day.

It's easy to buy stocks that has a lot of hype and upward momentum. I do wonder how many brought into GOOGL before their run up, MSFT before that, META before that, NFLX before that. 

AMZN is going no where, I am just buying more"
2025-10-18,I wish it would go down to $160 again!  If you are young you want to accumulate great companies at cheap prices.  Why would you want it to go to $300?  Then you wont buy any more or you will be overpaying
2025-10-18,"I caught 3 out of the 4 and buying more AMZN. My last buys were around $90 in 2023 and $170 in 2024, great value again today"
2025-10-17,Sell covered calls then.
2025-10-17,"I have. Made a good amount on it actually, but its getting riskier and risker"
2025-10-18,Let’s see a screen shot of these covered calls you’ve sold and made good money on cause I don’t believe it. If you really owned a mag 7 stock and were making “good money” on covered calls there is just zero reason to be upset
2025-10-18,Here ya go bud. This is just the last 10 days. Not tryna post 100 screenshots of trades i made this year selling covered calls lol. Cant believe i felt the need to be validated

2025-10-18,Skimming thru the screen shots seems like you’re selling to open and buying to close a couple days apart collecting a little premium? Hard to tell. Covered calls on AMZN is a good strategy recently that’s why I’m confused why youre mad about owning a great stock and making money on top of the long term potential. FOMO on other stocks running?
2025-10-18,The entry that is redacted is my direct deposit paycheck that has my company name. Not trying to dox myself
2025-10-18,The ones that are “buy” is me buying to close and selling the same one right away but at a later exp date. Because i ddint want the options to get exercised. I want them to expire worthless
2025-10-18,"Because the lower it goes, the riskier it gets to sell covered calls as it goes further away from my avg cost. Why shouldnt i be upset that a stock that ive owned for a long time isnt going up? Whether i sell covered calls or not is irrelevant"
2025-10-18,"It’s not irrelevant. If you’re not wanting to own the stock sell closer TTM calls and you’ll either collect the full premium and keep shares or you’ll have them get called away which won’t matter since you apparently don’t want to own the stock anymore. 

I’ll take a step back and say I get where you’re coming from. You own the stock because you want it to appreciate and it hasn’t been doing that. But you’re doing the right thing in a stagnant period and I think we can all agree AMZN isn’t done growing."
2025-10-17,You stupid fuck. You are getting leaps thats expiring in 2027 and coming here and asking am I cooked? You are not cooked just dca if you can if not wait and do nothing. You have 2 freaking years. But because you paid crazy money in premiums you wont have much profit from these leaps. It’s better to get shares at this point. Learn how to do options FIRST
2025-10-17,Just buy shares man jfc
2025-10-17,"Almost felt like to say sell it to me, i can pay you your original cost"
2025-10-17,I can't believe I'm a bag holder of Amazon.  Never thought it could be a possibility.  I need a drink
2025-10-17,"Im beginning to think I'm the only one left willing to hold for years and am ok bagholding.


Avg 220.


-Did my DD.
-Bezo entrusted me to baghold while he sells to fund his wife's lips.
-Bezo ex gives her regards as she sells to charity.


But in all seriousness.  Your fking bagholding mother fkin amzn.  Why the heck are ppl panicking as if amzn going to 0.


Also if amzn goes back to 180 or whatever, then most likely the entire market is fkin down."
2025-10-17,This post exemplifies how this sub is just full of newbs. Who in the hell is looking at a holding like this on a weekly basis?! 
2025-10-17,Buying more until earnings
2025-10-17,Guys just open up covered calls and print money lmao
2025-10-18,"I'm up 75% and chilling, hope it gets cheaper actually so I can buy more"
2025-10-17,Amzn is a good stock to trade. Been buying calls and selling in a day or two for easy flip. Rinse and repeat
2025-10-17,Fridays have been manipulation dumps. It's most probably red tomorrow
2025-10-17, Being in the red with Amazon tells you everything you need about their experience.
2025-10-17,"Saying that stocks ""obviously"" wont go back to a price from 6 months ago is absurd

No offense."
2025-10-16,Ex-wife sold lots of shares
2025-10-16,"ex wife is offloading her shares on discount to us. load it up, this going to moon when buying pressure reduces"
2025-10-16,"1$ pre market 
Lambo right there"
2025-10-16,Jesus people it will go up at earnings calm down
2025-10-17,"Buy and hold fellas, just buy and hold."
2025-10-16,Turns out trade war with China is bad for the largest importers and sellers of chineese goods.  Who would have guessed?

2025-10-17,It's ok. I'll counter it by selling mine
2025-10-17,Remember me when amazon hits $300 end of year. It was nice being a shareholder.
2025-10-17,"Haha, will do. As a 1/212000000 share holder, your sacrifice means a lot"
2025-10-16,They aren’t diluting. They are selling lol. Do you know what dilution means?
2025-10-16,You do realize the history of the market is 6 to 7% a year on average? These last five years have been insane and it’s not sustainable long-term for the S&P 500 to go up 20 to 30%. I feel like nobody understands that these are cartoon numbers. People act like if stocks aren’t going up 40%. They are absolute dog shit. lol
2025-10-17,"Dont even argue with this. I dont care about the stock price, that will eventually follow. This is a fundamentally ROCK SOLID company. 

  
Kinda funny you legit trying to play down amazon. 

  
Plantir or OPEN may be more your style...."
2025-10-16,How long have you held for?
2025-10-17,"I am down too. 

I was also down on AMD/GOOG far more, and for a good chunk of time which both came around."
2025-10-16,Compared to my other holdings. Definitely yes.
2025-10-16,you’d have to be at least 70-80% up on your investment?
2025-10-15,Red day AMZN red Green Day AMZN red
2025-10-16,Google did the same before the court judgement. Just hold and be patient. It will only shoot up immediately after you sell
2025-10-16,It’s so painful to hold this
2025-10-15,Will sell everything soon from this stock. Not worth to miss other opportunities.
2025-10-17,"This is my breaking point for this stock. I'm officially selling. Market is red; amazon is red. Market is green; amazon is red. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. But now that I will sell, it will go up so you're welcome."
2025-10-16,"Yes I don’t disagree. I think if you have a long time frame though then you’re fine. Just have to ignore short term noise. When the brown parcels stop piling up at every house on your road around Xmas and AWS is looked down upon, then I’ll sell. Until then I’m holding."
2025-10-16,Because I’m patient and it’s a good business. The market is designed to wear you out and I’m reading a lot of weariness.
2025-10-16,"Tell me more please. I am long time investor. Hold 60% of my portfolio in this. That said, you should think of lost opportunities. Last 5 years there are several stocks that beat Amazon. Hint: Boeing did better than this, so you can tell. 

It’s not just the business, it’s also about who is running the company. Jassy is a piece of shit!! I can tell you this, they have no AI strategy. Have you used any of their products outside e-commerce? Their newly launched Quick Suite is so bad. 

I am happy to be wrong here but Amazon is not being steered in a great direction, they are acting headless without Bezos."
2025-10-15,I think I am about to sell this shit. It’s half my portfolio but this is just dead money. I’m sure one day it will take off but being too early is the same as being wrong.
2025-10-15,Wait until earnings … right around the corner!
2025-10-15,Earnings might be deal maker or deal breaker for me. Been holding since 2013. Seriously starting to feel like the end of the party
2025-10-15,YTD -1.73 % damn wondering why this shit stock always red.
2025-10-15,"New to amazon , I thought it was a hold term holding stock? Can anyone give me a run down please."
2025-10-16,I also bought thinking to hold long term. Has been red every day since
2025-10-16,Maybe if this damn T admin would stop manipulating trade this $hit would settle the fuk down.
2025-10-15,"I’d wait at least for earnings later this month. Given that this stock has been flat, I don’t think the market’s expectations are high. So we could see it go up then."
2025-10-16,I bought it at 212. Planning to sell to break even.
2025-10-16,"Yes, please sell me more shares. Literally free money 🤑🤑"
2025-10-16,"Whenever the redditors start hating on a stock, it's usually a good time to buy.  There were similar  negative comments about GOOGL at $180, META at $90, and NVDA at $12."
2025-10-15,"There is no ""hold forever"" stock in tech, if u don't innovate, don't grow, u will be punished by the market, think IBM, Nokia, Intel etc."
2025-10-16,"Amazon is 15% of my portfolio at an average cost of $215 , do you think that's fine?"
2025-10-15,I bought at 224 tbh reluctant to turn unrealized loss into realized loss… Plans for me is to sell calls at 225 weekly until someone execute it …
2025-10-16,"I'm just a random redditor, so take it with a grain of salt.  I'm super confident with the business of Amazon and feel that I understand the long term prospects, so I would be completely fine with a 15% position.  I also think it's worth over $300 so not a bad cost basis imo.  I'm at around ~12.5% of my portfolio in Amazon currently, and actively buying."
2025-10-16,I'd also recommend reading the annual shareholder letter for a good understanding of what's happening in the business.
2025-10-15,How can you be down if the aveage price is 39 and its 218 right now?
2025-10-16,https://preview.redd.it/9a810s7dhbvf1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89a38d39d79846e75673df0bd28faf142cb7e492
2025-10-15,why you would invest 5 million in single stock? that is stupid
2025-10-15,What did you invest in?
2025-10-16,U didn’t buy no dip u bought a peak
2025-10-16,"Bro is keeping us afloat 💪 It's the leveraged AMZU fund (was mentioned in a prior post).

Had plenty of long running flat-ish down trending periods, only for Amazon's repeat solid earnings and cash flow to punch through the P/E and lift the boat.

https://preview.redd.it/u6xfow6j0bvf1.jpeg?width=3430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccc87ac3ed84e81e0a618b2a7024114e8662af04

The stock market is a popularity contest in the short term, but a weigh-scale in the long term, and we know Amazon is the whale chuning out revenue and profit every day on all fronts, and are growing market share with automation.

Meanwhile the negative-P/E AI kids pump their popularity by reporting frame orders, circular volume commitments, and cooperative marketing (purchase‑commitment style deals), just like Cisco did in '99 before the internet bubble valuation came back down to earth and was commodified."
2025-10-15,what if he has $100M in total
2025-10-15,That guy's tweet! People freakout and sell sec after and trend continues. This is getting more frequent now
2025-10-17,"Remember last time, killed earnings dropped like a rock. Ready for part 2? Going to drop under $200 this time"
2025-10-15,It alway ended with red. Put is good
2025-10-15,It was in recovery and then the cooking oil tweet happened. We couldn’t predict the orange man lmao
2025-10-14,"I notice the weird pattern for AMZN good news = down, bad news = down a lot than others, no news = still a down."
2025-10-14,nows the time to buy vro
2025-10-15,"Simply put Amazon is in CAPEX mode. Once it turns on the profit mode you will see the huge Ws.
I keep adding day and night below 220."
2025-10-15,"After today I'm out for good. This shit will barely beat inflation in the next 5 years, complete waste of time"
2025-10-15,"There is this very excellent business with a stock that is not overvalued over an extended period which gives everyone ample time to gradually buy it at a good price, yet people are just nagging about it. It’s disappointing to see how people are impatient and dumb!!"
2025-10-15,I will sell googl at 306 in December and use the proceeds to buy amazon at 216
2025-10-15,Just sell
2025-10-15,At $214 I had to buy in. I’m ready to be disappointed now
2025-10-15,I bought at 220 recently. It doesn't matter because I'm a long term investor and short term fluctuations don't matter.
2025-10-14,Everything is red today
2025-10-15,They always use that excuse of 'investment mode' to justify their underperformance.  Heard the same thing 5 years ago.  Stop dreaming.  Even really slowly movingn Caterpillar is up 3x in 5 years where Amazon is only up 30%.
2025-10-15,"Which miners, or did you buy a mining ETF?"
2025-10-15,Should hit easily...well..hopefully they don't screw up the earnings call.
2025-10-15,Where are they underperforming exactly? Don’t tell me about AWS. See the revenue it generates and compare it with others. Growth percentage slows when you have a really large revenue like that.
2025-10-15,Amazon is the least affected by AI hype. Their explosive EPS growth (and thus share price increase) will come from robotization of warehouses and delivery.
2025-10-15,"245 by year end is still… pretty poor on a % return basis. Amazon is - and I see this as someone with it as my second or third largest holding - simply uniquely exposed to downside right now, the market can see Bezos exiting quite a lot, and sees an unambitious CEO in Jazzy. 

I’d worry, and will be opportunistic about paring back my investment in the near future. 

I stuck with google as I fully believed the antitrust suit was resolveable (it actually went better than I expected) in a way which would satisfy markets. I’m less sure about Amazon’s present issues."
2025-10-15,You have it mixed up. Those were very undervalued assuming stuff that didn’t happen (DoJ trial and US healthcare crash). There are no bad or good news priced into Amazon cause it hasnt shown anything…yet.
2025-10-15,"I believe it is undervalued. 33 PE not at all resembles its future potential.
I think the market doesn’t understand the implications of Amazon’s current CAPEX and pipeline."
2025-10-15,"Dont get me wrong, it’s my 3rd largest position but I don’t consider it undervalued currently unless they prove they’re worth the premium vs Google."
2025-10-15,"Sure, I am not “attacking “ you either :)
I am just saying I believe it is undervalued (although in a different manner than GOOGL or UNH)."
2025-10-14,I wouldn't be as mad at holding Amazon if... if Tesla stock wouldn't perform that well. It's like watching a tank beating your yacht in the race just because the lake has dried up.
2025-10-15,I feel like Amazon is just about catching its stride lol. I'll sell in 2040
2025-10-15,Problem is Jassy sucks at marketing everything they’re doing.  Company is more or less firing on all cylinders and reinvesting all free cash flow.  Market just doesn’t care because he can’t get anyone excited.
2025-10-15,One good thing I did notice is that bezos hasn’t sold any shares prior to this earnings.  The past few earnings I noticed he sold a few weeks prior and the stock for that earnings has been worthless as far as the price moving.  Hopefully we don’t see an article of him selling this week or next and if not I think this piece of work should go over the 52 week high
2025-10-19,But if you bought at the bottom how much would the gains be? If you DCA the whole time why would the gains be? Seeing a lot of hate on AMZN for lagging growth on the 5 year chart but realistically who buys once and doesn’t add when high conviction stocks drop… especially if the baseline metrics are all going up…? I’m new to investing and am just about to hit 1 year in the market and have AMZN as a 13% position and am still up 20%+ for my portfolio
2025-10-14,Don’t worry all I have to do is sell and it will go to $300
2025-10-15,"Well, I sold. After holding for a decade I’ve had enough. So I’m sure it will go up now. You’re welcome."
2025-10-15,"Thanks for taking one for the team. It probably will go up now. If not, I will save everyone else and sell too so it can go up"

2025-10-14,"Congrats you sold something that will grow its revenue at over 20% a year for something that grows 5-10%.

But Apple does do heavy buybacks so its not impossible that it could outperform AMZN in those years but I doubt it"

2025-10-13,"Amazon is going to do very well in the future. AI will not only make the core business more efficient, but they will own major market share in providing the compute for the expansion of AI. We are not even close to the level of compute we need until we are able to generate full hour plus video without being throttled using AI. Highly recommend anyone to own some Amazon, Google and Microsoft for this reason. Amazon is just the one at the best price at this time"

Also Amazon is the best-positioned MAG7 to benefit from the upcoming robotic revolution."
2025-10-13,Everyone else is hyper scaling compute. Amazon has the worst engineering talent of all its competitors evidenced by their uncompelling AI offerings. When the dust settles AWS growth will be hurt and that’s all that has mattered for Amazon stock. I’m avoiding Amazon

2025-10-14,That's a good point.
2025-10-13,Pretty much! After they are successful with AI they will look to use robots in their warehouses. That is still 2-3 years or so away but Amazon is definitely a long term hold.
2025-10-13,Dude you’re tripping. Bedrock is incredible.
2025-10-16,Of course it could see $170-180 before it has its day. I've been debating if I should cut my position and try again later or suck it up (buttercup)

Anyways that’s not the point - it would certainly lead to some x% loss of growth, and did you not see how badly Amazon was punished by missing a minuscule % last ER? So stands to reason they would be punished along with the rest of the tech stocks, even if it’s not deserved, which it’s not IMO!"
2025-10-11,I work at Amazon as a developer and I can tell you that internal morale when it comes to AWS and the company as a whole is not very high. Andy Jassy's leadership has been awful. I really regret not selling my shares on vest.

2025-10-11,What? You're missing the point. If I had just sold my shares as soon as I got them over the past few years and invested them in the market I would be far FAR better off instead of me holding onto them. THAT is what I regret..

2025-10-09,Cooked. I have 1/16 $250c and it’s a money burning machine. I only lose on this stock
2025-10-09,Expiration is very short

You might kill it, who knows , but if you haven't already then consider leaps. Leaps give you the ultimate power to be wrong over a longer period of time than be right. Yes I hold AMZN $190c for late next year with tons of conviction and I sleep easy."
2025-10-12,I sold a put because I don't mind bagholding at this price. Wouldn't invest more than ur gambling fund in calls tho
2025-10-10,"actually learning, does that mean u were able to make money cuz the contract price change even if the stock price didn’t touch 250??"
2025-10-10,Yes. You buy at discounted prices after/during sell offs and wait for recovery (contract price will rise) with recovery of stock just cuz your calls are a certain strike doesn’t specifically mean you need amzn at 250
2025-10-10,"Could u share how you select the contracts, like what date? Do u usually buy cheaper ones irrespective of the date? Like for example a $250 contract for like $0.4 and the date doesnt matter and I wait for it to increase from 0.4?"

How do you justify the time lose opportunity with AMZN?  
Do you just do CC and accept that I am making something at least while underlying price is down or flat?

Funny thing is, I don't doubt AMZN will go up. Enough analysts are stating project ranier will increase the AWS growth as early as q3 of 2025. Even with all that, when you consider the weaken dollar value, we did lose a bit of money. 

\*\*If you got in during the liberation month, that has nothing to do with AMZN(or any other stocks for that matter) fundamentals giving strong indication for growth.

  
With all the negatives out, I am still holding. If not by q3(2025), at least by early next year, AWS growth should be 20% YoY or higher."

I would argue in the next 5 years, it will outperform every other stock in mag7 for so many reasons

It’s a consumer staple, as well as a tech giant, this has huge long term potential

Also in the case of a tech crash, Amazon will probably drop the least, as it’s not a “tech” only company"

2025-10-09,I'm up at quite a bit on Amazon it's one of my favorite to always buy on the dip as I think of Amazon as somebody that's going to always rule the world and ain't going anywhere and nobody's going to replace it I also dump money in TAMU which is kind of it's Chinese competition and it's also doing well as I bought that on the dip too
2025-10-10,I been buying since 2011 and still am… you simply don’t grasp the industry diversity this company brings
2025-10-10,Has the largest invested capital and will benefit the most from ai and robotics
2025-10-12,"I’d have to disagree — our entire modern economy is built on Amazon’s backbone. From logistics to cloud to AI infrastructure, they’re quietly powering the world.

Even after decades, Amazon is still in its early adoption phase from a global perspective. Historically, it’s delivered ~50% average returns over 3–5 year spans, and I’d argue its next phase of growth will be even more durable.

It’s not just an e-commerce giant — it’s a consumer staple, a logistics empire, and a leading AI/cloud company. Convenience, reliability, and scale are what keep customers — and businesses — locked in. Their return policy, delivery consistency, and Prime ecosystem make competitors look years behind.

Others can try to copy the model, but Amazon keeps evolving faster than anyone else. Long-term margins and dominance aren’t a fluke — they’re the result of a system that improves with every purchase, shipment, and data point."
2025-10-09,"Nvidias stock price is reliant on continued momentum of hyperscaling which is currently unprofitable +  insane payment promises being fulfilled, I'm not saying that's all gonna fall through but it's a risk and if it does then I would be glad i had a big chunk in amazon."

2025-10-10,"Buy? No. Trade, YES! Amazon is a great stock to own a core position on, and then trade calls and puts around it."
2025-10-19,To me Amazon at this point is almost like a mutual fund. It’s involved in so many different things that makes it a very safe investment.

2025-10-14,"I’d be wary with TEMU, honestly — and I say that with respect for anyone trying to find the next big win.

But this feels a lot like WISH 2.0. (Only even more plastic and even less quality)..The business model isn’t new; it’s just wrapped in shinier marketing and faster shipping. If you’ve ever been to Chinatown or a street market in China, you know the story — stuff that looks fine at first but falls apart once you actually use it. The “proof is in the pudding,” as they say.

TEMU thrives on selling ultra-cheap, mass-produced plastic goods. It’s not built on quality, brand loyalty, or sustainable value — it’s built on volume and curiosity. People buy once, maybe twice, then realize the products break, returns are a hassle, and the excitement fades fast.

If you’ve made money already, that’s awesome — take it as a blessing. But I’d lock in profits and diversify into something that builds real, long-term value.

Because let’s be real — investing in TEMU long-term is kind of like betting for a plastic pandemic. And the world doesn’t need more of that. 🙏🏽"
2025-10-09,"The tech companies have code and servers

2025-10-13,"Absolutely justified to be up that much over 10 years. It should honestly be up more than that, as within the past 5 years it’s up less than 30%. With their free cash flow and revenue increasing quarter after quarter every time, you can make an easy case that it is easily an undervalued stock"

2025-10-13,"They do reinvest most of their proceeds back into capex which can be by their overhead moves slower than the other Mag7. Institutions love when companies are stashing cash on hand due to increased financial stability, something AMZN is not doing at all. I feel like it may come down to the AI race in general. 
If it fails or generates less than expected revenue, AMZN will drop like a rock and their capex could be wasted.
If the AI story turns out to be a success.. well the stock may sky rocket.

I guess we’ll wait and see"

2025-10-09,900 shares of AMZN is still respectable; no need to feel bad about that. With your monthly additions you will continue to grow. You got this bro!
2025-10-09,$900 🤣
2025-10-09,3 shares or 300 - monthly additions will get you there. We all started somewhere. Hey; your AMZN shares are already up another 2% in a single day; It's a good one. 💪
2025-10-08,"Growing obviously tapers off the bigger you get. AWS is already huge, the biggest in fact.

  
Amazon has done nothing but improve revenue and profit, doubling every five years. At this rate, they will be over 1.2Trillion in revenue in five years.

Everyone who is shitting on Amazon stock right now doesn't understand when the market sentiment is bad, but the financial metrics are improving, that is the opportunity and time to BUY."

2025-10-08,"Good point, prioritization and allocation of resources, is maybe whats stopping the partnership. As the trainium build out ramps in Q4, that may allow some possibility for other vendors to lock in their allocation. Would be interesting to see if we hear anything about it in Q4."
2025-10-07,"This community (not OP) has turned really depressive lately 😅 But investors know this is a fun and the best time. This giant is allowing you to accumulate wealth. Not every ticker will give this chance. Tesla took off, Apple took off (I’m pretty sure both of them will surpass their all-time highs soon), then AMD, NVIDIA, and Meta, more. Trust me, when this thing takes off, you will scramble to buy more, but it will hardly give you the opportunity to do so. Have you ever heard of price manipulation? Take advantage of it."
2025-10-07,"It depends on your investment goals right? If you’re picking weeklies and cashing out, then who who care if AMZN will 100x in 2 years but not this week?"
2025-10-07,"Right, its like people in 2020 saying   
""If you think NVDA will keep rising but AMD will not then ...""  
And guess what? They were right, AMD rise didn't compare to NVDA at all. 

I dont mean by this comment SAME will happen to AMZN, but if some stocks in certain industry skyrocket it doesn't mean all will."
2025-10-07,"Amazon may be a good safety play if you believe in this a.i bubble, i think it will be better positioned than many if that pop was to occur"
2025-10-07,"lets not predict or hope and better see facts , i wont go through weeks or months time frame just check charts 1 year since oct 24 and see amzn movement and compare with other mag7 that should answer you why op and other are talking like this about amzn , we should agree and accept amzn is really a slow growth stock compared to any mag7 and it is slowing more with time , if you see something else , better to talk by numbers / charts / historic or similar times that would be better in such conversation"
2025-10-07,Agreed. I'm a terraible trader & make most of my gains just holding...
2025-10-07,"Point taken. I don't think it's an entirely fair comparison, as the well being of AMZN/MSFT/... is a causality of that of NVDA, while AMD and NVDA are direct competitors. That said, i agree that it's always riskier to bet on a single company than a sector or industry.."
2025-10-07,"sure, let's talk numbers. AWS is bringing $30b in q2, riding a double digit growth while still being the top cloud vendor. its cloud market share (30%) is still roughly the combination of azure and gcp. being a tech worker myself, i sometimes feel that the market just concentrates too much on one thing. Sure big AI players all need GPUs. that doesn't mean that everyone stops paying AWS for S3, EC2, etc. And even if the market is rewarding capex spending, amazon poured $102.95b in the trailing twelve months. That's more than MSFT's expected $80b capex in 2025.

  
i think that numbers can only get us so far in this market. obviously that is a very biased stmt... allow me to still take GOOG as the example. remember when the sentiment was so low on search that Apple SVP's one sentence tanked its share by 8%? Then the antitrust settlement sent the stock to its ATH. what has change for GOOG? has it stopped filling the results with SEO garbage? has it relied signifcantly less on Ads revenue in the past two months? did we not know that Gemini 2.5 was genuinely a good model a few months ago before the antitrust settlement?

  
but you're right that it is a possibility for AMZN to dangle at this level for another year. i'm not trying to predict an immediate breakout. In fact I also hold positions in CRWV and NVDA> I guess my original intention was - besides bringing some sense of comfort lol -  just to say that AMZN seems more like a safe bet now,"
2025-10-07,I work for Amazon. I do believe there’s a lot of room for growth but I’m over exposed so I sell my RSUs on vest
2025-10-08,"1. I am an angry bag holder, but happier now that I decided to sell covered calls. Makes about $800/mn per contract. 


2. Your experience means nothing. The results show that cloud is growing double digits, membership is growing, and orders are growing. 


3. My experience is that in brick and mortar shopping is absolute ass and 9/10 times more expensive. I make like 75-85 orders a year and my wife makes the same amount. Prime tv is pretty solid with a lot of options. Audible is expensive but most people I know have it. Amazon healthcare is getting its foot in the door and likely will grow much more. 



The stock sucks. The company is great. But this is when you make money investing, it’s the inefficient market everyone is looking for. No one wants to buy when it’s low and hated, even if it’s a great company with solid growth."
2025-10-08,"Do you have any sources beyond vibes? AWS grew 18% in Q2, so there isn’t any evidence that so called trend. 


I’m literally GenZ, I know there are other online stores but are any as convenient as Amazon? Do any offer auto-ship with enough variety that no household goods run out with a 15% discount? (Well chewy does for pets but Amazon is almost as good). There’s maybe 1 other company I can order bananas, prescription meds, toilet paper, pair of shoes, 3D printer, a boat anchor and fishing line at the same time to get to my house in 15 hours. The moat is literally that I don’t have to order from 3 different websites after comparing prices with another 5 websites then not having same day or next day delivery, then have to remember where I ordered everything. I don’t need to have Wayfairs app,  3A marine’s app, new eggs app, target app, and chewy app to make one order I could’ve made on Amazon in the time it takes to download. 




We can also go into Amazons entire infrastructure as a moat that only Walmart and Costco can compete with. But those companies don’t have the same quality of automation that Amazon has. Oh that leads to amazon robotics and how 75% of their warehouse is automated. People think too short term, Amazon can flip a switch and increase margins a few percent. Doesn’t sound like much but when you’re talking revenue of $1T+ a few percent is in the tens of billion range. 

You sound like someone investing on vibes and not actually looking into the company and its customers."
2025-10-07,"Dont worry, this is a problem across all the top tier companies. These are like seasonal parasites. They won't harm long term.

2025-10-07,"Do you guys all own a single stock of like $2000? Why are you posting here like its a support group? 

Very weird behavior - buy other things people and enjoy one of the great bull markets of your life"
2025-10-07,"Please sell, tired to see posts like this"
2025-10-06,Wondering if i should take my $700 loss on leaps and just redistribute into my spy leaps lol
2025-10-06,"I feel your pain, but The comments regarding google are valid. I plan to hold to the end of the year and will start to unload a big chunk of my position in early 2026."
2025-10-07,Since it never goes anywhere far it’s a good stock to sell covered calls on at least.
2025-10-07,"AWS might be challenged, loads of competition? Its a good company though…. I am up 30% . Holding but not adding"
2025-10-07,"Well I’ve been accumulating…
If and when it starts its bull run it will be up very very fast."
2025-10-06,why are people so caught up in short term results?  it'll never change I tell ya.
2025-10-08,Sell it back please
2025-10-07,Get back if you want to bet on the earnings at the end of the month
2025-10-06,I think Amazon's biggest issue is their share dilution. Other big tech companies are reducing share count while amazon keeps increasing their share count.
2025-10-07,Just need them to say they partnered with OpenAI or Nvidia or intel.
2025-10-07,5 years is an incredibly short holding period for a company like Amazon.
2025-10-07,You’re not an investor
2025-10-07,Why you sad about Meta bro? 6 months $200 up.  What else you need?
2025-10-06,That would be bullish for AMD but not necessarily Amazon right
2025-10-07,"Since it never goes anywhere, IV would be low so even those covered calls are chump change"
2025-10-06,">5 years

>short term results

Lmfaooo"
2025-10-06,Youre right. And i did. I probably won’t sell Amazon.

Other investors on twitter feel the same as us too"
2025-10-07,"Right, as soon as i sell it’d probably blast to $400"
2025-10-07,"Honestly. Who am i kidding i wont sell amzn lmao. Amzn, aapl, meta…theyre titans that sit around and then jump occassionally but steadily"
2025-10-05,It could probably trade sideways till the end of the year . It’s down YTD compared to SPY’s 15% run . It’s basically underperformed during Andy Jassys tenure as CEO
2025-10-07,Amazon is no longer considered one of the MAG7 with this returns.
2025-10-04,"We're below where we were 3 months ago. When Amazon bounces back it bounces back hard. I'm doing short term calls this week and Jan 2026 calls, we going back up"
2025-10-05,It’ll go up now. I sold covered call
2025-10-04,"Earnings next month better provide clear path to impressive growth specially in AWS, otherwise this bitch will tank 🫣"
2025-10-05,I just buy put. It will rip soon
2025-10-03,"At $5m, i would put in qqq, and retire in Vietnam."
2025-10-05,Bought $3k worth. Not king like you but it’s all I got
2025-10-06,"Goodness, you should diversify, but definitely will run up at the end of year"
2025-10-15,"I have 3,000 shares in AMZU. Still keep adding. Lol"
2025-10-02,Looks like my future kids will be the Amazon bagholders on my behalf
2025-10-02,"* No sharebuybacks since 2022
* Constant diluation, shares outstanding keep increasing quarter after quarter
* Bezos keeps unloading"
2025-10-02,"Relax, barring any crazy geopolitical or US economic shit Amazon will rise nicely into earnings. YTD it hasn’t done dick despite two major earnings beats. MAG7 is like musical chairs, this time Amazon will finally hit."
2025-10-03,"accumulation phase. within the next 5 years, you’ll be wishing it was still $220 a share"
2025-10-06,I sold my 300 shares out at $235 in early Sept. It’s been a real turd since the split.  I moved it to other places and am already up a nice amount.
2025-10-04,I’ll sell my entire life savings of 8 shares so it’ll moon for the rest of you guys
2025-10-03,Waiting for $300 on my end.  😅😅
2025-10-03,"If consumer spending slows, why would anyone think Amazon’s stock is going to skyrocket? Be happy for steady growth over time now. More and more people are tightening up their spending and buying less and that will only continue to get worse as we start to see people’s healthcare costs rising, consumer goods costs continuing to increase, etc…"
2025-10-05,"I was actually counting on $250 by the end of the year, which I thought was a conservative estimate..."
2025-10-02,"They quietly announced same-day grocery delivery even for small towns across the US; and free shipping w/ prime. This tells me Amazon has made massive efficiency gains in their overall supply chain from warehouse to home. I don't know how other grocery competitors are going compete without taking heavy losses on warehouse fulfillment, which currently competitors do manually.  This is going to cut into the grocery portion of Walmart and even Costco, and might start the death-knell for already squeezed pure-grocery companies, just like what Netflix did to corner rental shops and what Amazon did to bookstores.

Also - with the political environment scaring people from air travel and even getting tangled up with ICE agents roaming the streets, this timing couldn't be more ideal to let citizens pivot to use Amazon grocery.

On the AI front - looks like Amazon is keeping the Anthropic crew firing on all cylinders, because they just released Claude 4.5. Here's the write up, https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5 -- check out the comparisons against competing LLMs further down on that page.

Remember the Anthropic guys were once OpenAI's core team but they left in 2021 to stand up their own company.  Since then, Claude's been (and continues to be) the leading software development llm (handily beating the latest from chatgpt and google) -- if you're not a software developer, ask anyone you know. Oh, they also have a VSCode plugin that lets you increment changes forward and backward; yeah - I'm a huge fan lol. This is going to translate to Claude gaining subscriptions ahead of the competitors.

Also, the Claude LLM and anyone else using API-based LLM dev tool (like pytorch) are making calls into a hardware agnostic backend, where Amazon has a mix of NVidia, AMD, and their own tranium 2 and 3 chips. The Tranium chips have several fold more memory (for larger context) and also several fold more network throughput than even Nvidia's latest blackwell chips - and tranium's are being produced without the 75% profit markup the other shops are handing over to Nvidia.

This is why you see the NVidia->OpenAI-Oracle partnering announcements (Amazon's got the A team in both hardware and software).

On stock price, we're now at the 4-week mark prior to earnings - these short spikes down all look like stop raids for market makers to scoop up as many cheap shares as possible. This last week I've watched volume outpace orders which indicates heavy buying. They'll use that warchest (purchased at the $220 range) to sell into the rips in the coming weeks and control volatility."
2025-10-03,Your phrasing is a bit strange. Are you saying you’re bullish or bearish
2025-10-06,"They are saying “Amazon is going nowhere (it will always be here). Amazon keeps diversifying their business. The stock is ready for 30% upswing”.
In other words, they are bullish"
2025-10-03,"Low margin, but durable and predictable/recurrent. It's partly why Walmart has P/E of 38x and Costco is 50x (both much higher than Amazon!). Just WMT and COST combined have a 1.2 T market cap, which I believe Amazon is 'primed' lol to eat into (as well as those 2nd and 3rd tier grocery conglomerates that are even more labour & cost-intensive)."
2025-10-01,"Good news = down, bad news = down...what do we do?"
2025-10-01,Amzn pump? To the red direction
2025-10-02,Man I need it to pump to 225 so I can close all my calls. It was a mistake buying Amazon cuz this ceo has zero innovation
2025-10-02,"😂😂I feel AMZN is magic stock, Green Day = down, Red Day = down a lot!"
2025-10-02,almost closed red lmao what a joke.  get rid of this CEO.
2025-10-01,Probably a sign to sell lol
2025-10-02,We did pump lol $1.00 yay!!! Green is Green. Andy Jassy is proud for sure.
2025-10-02,"My dumb ass keeps buying as it drops. Come the f*ck on, Jeff!"
2025-10-03,"Why you all want it to pump, I want it to go down so I can buy more."
2025-10-01,"You forgot to add no news, it’s down anyway. Good riddance."
2025-10-02,"short it, of course"
2025-10-02,you buy
2025-10-02,I'm selling 225C expiring this week 💀
2025-10-02,He will blame his employees for just about everything it seems while he collects his $$$
2025-10-02,Yeah I had 15 250c for 1/16. I sold 10 for a loss of $400 and the other 5 I’m losing $1.2k 😭if it somehow pumps to $230 I’ll breakeven with those 5 contracts I still got left
2025-09-29,"I need 235, so I can trim my position. This thing is an absolute dog. Not selling it all though. Best of luck to all! ✌🏻🍀"
2025-09-27,Hoping 260. Hold my breadth
2025-09-27,"Man this is like google all over again. Just hold, it will rise easily 20-30%"
2025-09-27,It’s sitting at $220. Double down and buy more. It’s Amazon. They have their hands in everything.
2025-09-27,$300 by year end
2025-09-27,We already hit over $240 in February smh. I was hoping this sub would be more bullish.
2025-09-28,240 end of October
2025-09-27,Just $240 😔
2025-09-28,$300
2025-09-30,"Great company, with an ineffective leader. He's the sole reason why the stock is performing the way it is. I took a small loss and sold my $500k holdings and glad I did. I made more money on other bets I made. Longer term, I have no doubts amazon will do well. Or maybe sooner, if they fire Jassy boy."
2025-09-27,Agreed $2.40 by year end is spot on. Damn Jassy. Even Trump won't invite him to the White House. 
2025-09-27,"yeah it was $242 in february before it went too $160 due too weak guidance around that time and trumps tariffs scaring everyone. It was around 235 recently, i thought it would go above 240 again but they released weak guidance again which caused it too go around $220. Like i said on another post, these guys have been shooting themselves in the foot this year."
2025-09-27,lol Jassy should just get fired. Zero influence inside company and zero outside.
2025-09-27,I sold put credit spreads
2025-09-27,"Uuuuuhhhhh. I’ve been invested in AMZN for about a year and consistently invested into it. Though buying a call for $240 when that is its 52 high and hasn’t really pushed passed 235 since then, it seems risky. But if you have hope that it will get passed $240-$250 please lmk because I’m losing all hope with AMZN rn"
2025-09-27,Right on man I’m with you on this! I got $35k Mar2026 260C! How long do you think you’ll hold?
2025-09-27,For $4k. U can do 10/31 calls as well as it gets bump for earnings
2025-09-28,Fomc will tell us if we are back to the bull market pump cycle
2025-09-29,Third person I’ve seen anticipating a breakout.  Mainly through earnings.   Let it rocket!!!
2025-09-29,Im also in for about $5000 but on 10/10 220 calls and I am currently down about 10%. Looking for a quick turnaround this week.
2025-09-30,$open is the better option
2025-09-30,$240 strike is not smart🤦‍♂️
2025-09-30,Market is at All Time High…. It shall correct soon… good luck anyways… Market nowdays is unpredictable than used to be…
2025-09-28,"You need to learn to that markets actually go down! Frankly, you need to learn the hard way! I will be shorting Amazon and all tech hand over fist! Do some research please"
2025-09-28,"That's max pain based on a small number of LEAPs and long term buyers and sellers; if you watch open interest it swells up massively like a tide at both the 4-week DTE and in the week prior - so that's when max pain has the largest effect to push around the price.

(Reminds me of the $230 to $220 -$10 step down that happened this last week.. market makers had to defend against the massive open interest in the call chain)."
2025-09-30,"Except AMZN had not moved YTD. It was 241 back in January. Every one was talking shit about googl and amzn. Till they realized googl was the shit and it rocketed. 


AMZN is the last mag7 to have not sky rocketed. It is time that it will and it will be during it's earnings report. It is a 240 stock."
2025-09-27,The amount of people ripping GOOG ceo before it went above 200 was the same. Then they got the lawsuit break and everyone loves all things Google now
2025-09-27,Would just hold till earnings. You have till January. Never what could happen till then.
2025-09-27,I have the same strike but expiry in March. Definitely hold out until after earnings and the Santa rally.
2025-09-27,Proof me wrong. Buy puts
2025-09-26,Jesus. My ass would be fully puckered. You're lucky we bounced pretty solidly off 217 today
2025-09-26,You’ll be good
2025-09-26,"Thanks to creative fund managers, and the propensity for retail gamblers these days there are a number of funds that have popped up focused on leveraging leverage to increase ROI - the truth is these funds will trend to zero over a long period of time and they should only be held for brief periods…which makes you wonder why you wouldn’t just buy the options directly."

Who said we don’t buy the options directly?"
2025-09-25,I think Amazon will struggle to hire AI talent as long as they have RTO5.
2025-09-25,By end of year it’ll be $300 a share
2025-09-25,Amazon can be a frustrating stock to own. My guess is it trades side ways for a bit but then we get this random push to $300 later this year.
2025-09-25,When they will change current CEO Andy
2025-09-25,Andy just needs to guide and not fuck up the conference call October 30th
2025-09-25,"If it dips, just buy it. Simple"
2025-09-25,When I sell
2025-09-26,Google was severely undervalued and now is slightly above fair value. Amazon has always been trading above its fair value - so for the stock to move the fundamentals need to shift up. Google could pop based on sentiment shift alone purely because of its valuation. Valuation matters
2025-09-25,Do you have a crystal ball?   let me know when Andy dies.  that day it doubles.  He could be retired it just doubles that day
2025-09-25,You’re talking about pump now? Isn’t it a bit too late. Market sentiment gonna change to bearish sooner than later. Even papa JPOW said so
2025-09-25,It’ll pump the moment we sell. Happens to me all the time.
2025-09-25,"We don’t need an AI pump, we need buybacks."
2025-09-25,"Not likely. CEO is not investing as much in hiring top talent and taking his sweet time to read through mails on office bureaucracy that barely exists. He is also spending time saving pennies while cutting employee benefits, like phone allowance etc. While all other CEOs are investing time on new initiatives, hiring top talent, acquisitions, Mr.Jassy is busy with this -> [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/amazon-ceo-jassy-says-company-cutting-bureaucracy-to-be-like-a-startup.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/amazon-ceo-jassy-says-company-cutting-bureaucracy-to-be-like-a-startup.html)"
2025-09-30,Calls for Amazon earnings is increasing in volume.   Let’s go
2025-09-26,"It got pretty rampant where WFM employees were exploiting tech companies by running multiple jobs at a time - often 2 but up to 5 roles held simultaneously. ""Job hacks"" and ""salary hacks"". It's  a huge payoff for little consequence, and a non-trivial percent of staff were doing this. 

Yeah - it's 100% on the team lead to ramp up and get the person delivering - but this can be drawn out months with carefully feigning personal life hick ups (and down-tooling on your other jobs to actually ramp up a bit more toward the recently acquired role). 

The ideal sweet spot is to get your team lead to lower expectations as you deliver the minimum results just to avoid getting fired. Worst case for the job-hacker is they bail from the highest expectation role *""I realize I wasn't able to deliver at the pace needed given my life circumstances, etc""*. There are folks on reddit bagging about running this for years. It's a morale‑killer and puts extra load on the real full-time workers who have to pick up the slack.

RTO is the strongest way to defeat this, and managers can re-grant WFM at the personal level for solid employees who have known work productivity."
2025-09-25,Amazon is a great buy for when the AI bubble pops and revenue matters again
2025-09-25,Please sell
2025-09-25,This. The party is over. Be smart and take profit.
2025-09-25,"I hope not, I sold $295 covered calls exp 1/16/206. How bout $285?"
2025-09-25,next earnings conference
2025-09-25,The warehouse isn't even all that bad. I've been working in one for almost 6 years now. Its one of the better jobs of this type that one can get. Amazon just gets a lot of people fresh out of high school that don't yet realize the reality of having to work for a living and then they complain about everything.
2025-09-25,Sir those expired 1819 years ago!
2025-09-25,Rip - go a 4th round of exceeding analyst expectations and still dip price.
2025-09-29,"https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Amazon,Google,Facebook&track=Software%20Engineer

This isn’t true. This opinion sounds like it’s from someone outside the industry.

It’s actually Google that pays relatively poorly because of their reputation for stability and work-life balance. It’s also funny you talk about Meta because their conditions are actually the worst out of the big dogs - they compensate for that with high salaries and that company is full of mercenaries. Amazon is known for having shitty middle management but besides that conditions are okay and pay is pretty good."
2025-09-26,I was there 6 years. No liked it except for the directors and they aren’t the AI talent. No one below L7 had anything good to say about it except for the pay and the pay is better elsewhere.

2025-09-24,"Seeing it up 1.5% pre market and now 0.1% and almost red just hurts man. Can we catch a little break, please?"
2025-09-25,We will be super GREEN if Amazon will figure out a way to get Bezos back and put Andy Jassy else where. The company has been the worst stock to hold. The current CEOs performance has been the worst. These are signs typically companies see before they fall flat. wink....anyone remember Yahoo?

I got assigned shares back in May after selling puts. Up 15% since then. And been selling calls weekly. Total return around 20%. Not too bad."

This will catch up soon and cause long lasting trouble for Amazon. When the world is investing in top talent and hiring, this joker is investing his time in senseless actions internally and cutting small perks for employees and thinks he is going to get the stock up. What’s the point just being a cloud provider of GPUs? Ain’t no way a company can just do that and survive. Too many options out there now."

2025-09-24,Another example of price drives sentiment.
2025-09-25,You don’t drive a car by driving in the rearview mirror. Do you like the company? Do you like the growth prospects? Do you find the valuation attractive? The answer to these questions should let you conclude whether you should buy/own the stock. Not recent trading. Only looking at a graph is how neanderthalers would be buying stocks.
2025-09-24,I thought we get more stock to match target comp?
2025-09-24,"I least care about the internal employee happiness factor. My happiness is directly related to stock growth. 

As an employee I am not talking about the happiness factor here it’s about company growth. I am sharing that the company is not doing well under Jassy. He has shared QoQ guidance that did not meet Wallstreet expectations, we are lagging behind every company in terms of innovation. Oracle was able to make huge deals, hiring talent, Meta is making strides in AI, VR, google is moving fast they have Gemini. What metric tells you that Amazon has been doing well?"
2025-09-24,"lol  alright 😂. Thanks for the arrogance. 

I am a red badge (> 10 years) employee and been with AWS since I joined in 2013."
2025-09-24,"You do, but your award for next year assumes that the stock will grow 15% in the current year. If it doesn’t, you aren’t going to hit your total comp. This is especially painful if the stock plummets right after they generate comp statements so the drop in value isn’t taken into account (which happened this year)"
2025-09-24,"Correct. No progress!! We can’t just be selling GPUs in data centers. Innovation should come for this company to move forward. Engineers and leaders are leaving the company. There is a huge hiring freeze internally, when companies are in a hiring spree to attract top talent. What good did AWS do in the past year or so? None. We just host other models and have become a market place. Very hard to make profits. Company has become day 2 when you stop innovating."
2025-09-25,lol what? He built AWS? Credit goes to the engineers and leaders back then and thanks to Bezos for approving. I don’t pack packages 📦.
2025-09-25,great!! Because Amazon sucks at building something like Gemini. That answers why you Amazon isn't going anywhere. Would be good to see you answer what growth prospects do you see? Why do find the valuation attractive?
2025-09-26,"Wait so, if stock stays same next year, i don’t get more RSU? I would not reach target comp"
2025-09-26,"Exactly, employees like you are the problem with Amazon. We don’t know what the fuck “red badge”,  or fucking L6 means. What working at AWS as janitor?? Whatever cult shit is going in Amazon, keep that shit inside. When you’re out of Amazon learn to say shit like other people understand, no wonder stocks are bad.. jeez"
2025-09-26,Lol not base pay. The conversation above was discussion regarding RSUs. They increased base pay but RSUs were always for the following year. They did so to compete and meet the hiring targets. Get your point though.
2025-09-26,"Yes my friend. That’s right. They will however, give you some additional stocks in 2027 to compensate for this lol 😂. Next year stock target estimate is $250 I believe. They will probably beat that and a bit more so they pay you less in 2027 too."
2025-09-26,lol if you don’t understand Cloud business why you invest? I answered because we can tell as employees what’s going on on the company and what difference we see between CEOs. Bezos vs Jassy. This is important for you investors to understand. Don’t be a dumb investors and chase the name.
2025-09-27,"“Red badge” and “L6” not a business model, that’s your hierarchy and internal bureaucracy. No one wants to know about whatever your cult system going on there. You could’ve just said that you are senior so and so or executive. You just assumed everyone who invest stocks knows about your org structure and this is why employee like you don’t understand the scope and not delivering it."
2025-09-26,Just keep buying. It will all blow over.
2025-09-24,I would think OP is talking about the crazy bounce upward after the legal ramifications of Google monopoly settled and priced in as a nothing burger… then Google ran up 25-30% in a few days to weeks… but Google was way undervalued… so is Amazon… I been buying but it has taken the largest portion of my equity and has been since a decade… I love to probably own more… probably like 10-15% more but one I don’t have unlimited funds and too concentration issues…
2025-09-24,"I think the conditions for Amazon is far different from Google’s, googles legal problems had a deadline, to the market it’s predictable. Amazon’s problem is the trump administration and the tariff threats that is putting a lot of uncertainty to its online retail and logistics business units. The market doesn’t know how long or when it’s more tariffs or other trade barriers are coming? So I guess investors are taking a more cautious approach for Amazon."
2025-09-24,Robotics would really lower their overall cost over time and widen margins on their online warehouse scenario… tariffs has pass thru cost but yes overall reduces margins for sellers…
2025-09-24,Interesting take. I would agree. Luckily their income stream also has AWS retails and ads… but they do probably need to increase margins in retail by deploying more tech and robotics but beyond that I don’t see a way out due to tariffs…
2025-09-24,"Yeah other business units are impacted less but indirectly there are at risk too as AWS needs servers and chips and those are also targeted for tariffs. 

I don’t think it’s the amount that people are most worried about, it’s the unpredictability and uncertainty that is holding back investors."
2025-09-23,"I'm investor from Europe, therefore not only USD fall is giving me tears, but AMZN as well. 2x tears at the same time lol."
2025-09-23,If you sell it will take off like a rocket. You know that right. Thats why you hold. Until then take your beatings like a good boy.
2025-09-23,Just be patient my friend amazon is going nowhere but up add to it  long-term hold
2025-09-24,Do you think all stocks just go up all the time?  Do you understand investing? I don;t get all these weird posts.
2025-09-23,$50 per week dca. It's all I can do otherwise I would lose my mind with this stock
2025-09-23,AMZN is a long-term investment. It’s not going to 🚀 like spec stocks but over time it will go up plenty. Balance your profile with spec stocks that can give you the dopamine hit you’re looking for.
2025-09-26,"I bought it February at 220.66, a day before the trump market crash. Held through april crash, I was down more than 100k, but I held. Just hold and buy the dip yall"
2025-09-24,"Good day to sell some cash secured puts, and close some short calls. 

Not everything is bad news when the price falls."
2025-09-23,"I think I’m too stubborn to sell but it might be time to accept I wasn’t right. The market doesn’t see Amazon the way I do. I was so certain Amazon would go to $300 soon but it just isn’t happening,"
2025-09-25,Please sell so that we can profit from the rocket
2025-09-27,Op you are the bull bullish on Amazon
2025-09-23,Your average price is 39.02?? You basically bought the top.
2025-09-24,You alive? or did you sell?
2025-09-24,Lol It's AMZN he has 0 reason to sell.
2025-09-17,Amazon has encountered a lot of resistance. Seems the news flow never goes its way.
2025-09-17,difficult to buy amazon when you can buy google or meta for cheaper PE
2025-09-17,I just dcs $50 per week for past year into it and seems to be working ok so far. Up 17% so far
2025-09-18,"The company is maturing and facing much more competition in its cash cow’s industry, AWS. Market is forward looking. Still a solid hold for me though. Long term I’m not worried. AMZN is a household name."
2025-09-18,Long period of consolidation.  Looks like a premium christmas breakout is in the cards same as last fall.
2025-09-19,For about a year and a half my portfolio was almost all AMZN. Gave me a lot of gains and I rotated out when tariff fears were very high at 214 a share.  Such a great company with incredible products and capabilities but the leadership from Jassy has been so disappointing. With better leadership AMZN could do even more!
2025-09-19,Feels like their CEO is the Tim Cook of Apple.  Bezos was the innovator (jobs) and Jassy the master operator.
2025-09-17,"Use P/OCF to value AMZN. 

It is still low historically but not the lowest. It makes more sense to track this metric with heavy Capex cycles"
2025-09-18,Because the CEO doesn’t know how to do his marketing. He let the Zoox launch in Vegas slip and the Netflix advertising through Amazon ads slip. Today he was in news talking about removing bureaucracy at work. He should focus on marketing like Elon. This guy should be fired.
2025-09-18,"And their CEOs are better at marketing than Amazon CEO, who doesn’t seem to understand what’s important for the company."
2025-09-18,"P/E is not a good measure to compare though because Amazon aims to reinvest all of its earnings in new growth so very modest earnings are always reflected.

It has been “overpriced” to all the others on P/E terms for 20 years"
2025-09-18,"Yeah this is an interesting discussion to have not sure why you were downvoted.

Fast growing pre-profit companies it usually makes sense to use P/S to compare to its peers because the earnings are not there yet.

EV/EBITDA makes the most sense across all stage companies.

I wonder what makes sense for Amazon because it always writes down all its earnings with spend.  P/OCF might be it."
2025-09-18,That’s actually a pretty good metric to consider. Common stocks and uncommon profits touched on the topic of capex cycles and the corresponding returns.
2025-09-18,"I don't like him either to be honest.  I love the company, but I really dislike the CEO.  Like, a lot."
2025-09-21,The CEO has the energy of a cardboard. Absolute trash. AMZN is up 21% since 2021 highs. Attrocious
2025-09-18,"We don’t need another Elon, but I agree there is a level of ‘I DGAF about stockholders’ from the CEO that is just unacceptable, and he seems to live there."
2025-09-18,"Not 100% but Im pretty sure cap ex expense is seperate from a companies earnings and is on a companies statement of cash flows. Free cash flow would be what to look for taking capex into account.
Ive looked at the income statement down to the eps and theres no sign of ppe, whats left is calculated into pe ratios.

Its true that pe ratios arent good for amazon tho. I think amazons eps seems low per share because they are, atleast relative to the price were willing to pay per share. what makes the pe high is because people are willing to pay a lot for the growth and knowing the amazon has a lot of profitability levels to pull when the time is right. peg ratios might be of better use but still doesnt really factor current profitability opportunities like when amazon flipped the switch on ads."
2025-09-18,It’s also improving net margins significantly and the ads is like aws in terms of profits margins. This can be a 10 p/e with with this price in 2028…
2025-09-20,"He's a fucking ass hole, but everyone as rich as him tends to be.

I saw him giving an interview after going to space with musicians.
As he was standing alongside one of them while they were recounting their tremendous experience, some attractive women came up. Jeff interrupts, says ""one sec"", walks over to these girls and starts spraying them with champagne, laughing away. TV crew still rolling, artist looking totally belittled, and Jeff acting 19 again."
2025-09-18,"Agreed we don't need a Elon just anecdotal but ya its crazy CEO doesn't care at all. Zero investment, hiring top talent for AI."
2025-09-18,It’s more about marketing to attract new investors than for new customers imo.
2025-09-21,Jeff isn’t the CEO anymore btw
2025-09-13,"Wow 1500 shares.
I was pretty happy with my 25 today lol"
2025-09-12,"Amazon is lagging It’s peers because it’s been overpriced for years and its growth is lagging its peers. It has the same PE as Microsoft and Microsoft has been ripping. 

I still own it but all these posts about how it’s time for a run don’t make any sense"

2025-09-12,When Jeff and his wife finally sell enough shares to fund whatever it is they’re selling shares to fund.
2025-09-15,Holding 95 shares
2025-09-13,"Same here... I bought some longer dated calls yesterday as it was dropping (unfortunately it dropped further). When it dropped again today, I decided instead of continuing to plow money into the calls, I'd buy some shares instead. Fingers crossed for a bounce "
2025-09-13,what strike price/experation?
2025-09-13,"So true, I have a few shares, but lack conviction. Valuation and growth aren’t super attractive."
2025-09-16,"yeah, all these wishful thinkers while Alphabet breaks the $3T market cap and going higher."
2025-09-12,"Amazon’s e-commerce is the last reason you should buy the stock. AWS, cloud computing, data storage is where it’s at."

2025-09-13,245 October 3rd
2025-09-14,"No, interest cuts have nothing to do with Amazon calls. Amazon is a great company, it's been trending down for nearly a week, this is a pattern I've been seeing as of late when the stock has a down slide, that its going to frickin pop soon. I always pick calls with long DTEs sonin the event I'm wrong I buy myself time and or can buy down the option"
2025-09-17,Long DTE? October 3rd? 2025??
2025-09-08,250$ calls coming hot before October end
2025-09-08,"Stay careful, Jeff is still offloading his shares really fast"
2025-09-08,Long or short?
2025-09-09,I would rather it drop back to $150
2025-09-09,Yep. This is definitely holding back the stock. Married life is expensive when you're the third richest man in the world.
2025-09-09,I'm proud to own shares that were once owned by Jeff Bezos himself.
2025-09-08,Long - 250 strike

2025-09-11,Do you buy just calls or stocks?
2025-09-10,I sold some LULU puts. So far so good. Hopefully that's the bottom for LULU. Ironically I have a cat named LuLu .

2025-09-03,"Setup my ass, officially worst performing even when you compare it to Boeing stock. No matter who agrees or disagrees, this has been worst stock to hold. Save yourselves folks. Prime membership signup and stickiness has decreased too. Read the Reuters news that came out today. Don't hold your breath for this stock to go up."
2025-08-31,Most patterns like the one you're using aren't very useful. The best pattern to know is that: most breakouts fail. It could just be a triple test to the downside. But I assume it will eventually break new highs so long as the s&p continues to rise and macroeconomic conditions are stable.
2025-08-30,"I’m holding for 10+ years, so I don’t care in short term."
2025-08-31,Yes good time to sell rn

2025-08-29,my baba stock carrying my port green today
2025-08-30,"Yup; AMZN and MSFT are the two strongest of the MAG7 today. META, NFLX, NVDA, AMD all down 2x what AMZN is, and we're still above the pre-jackson hole risk off day, even on today's PCI ""risk-off"" trade.

Most of the negativity here will be coming from short-term option call buyers who probably high expectations after yesterday's fast run up only to have their options now well out-of-the-money by today's small consolidation. I've been there too; it's painful!"

2025-08-27,Amazon is a long term hold and I wouldn't worry too much about them.
2025-08-28,"You convinced me to buy more. This company dominates retail, has new ventures opening up new revenue streams, and is a foundational core of the internet. More Americans have a prime membership than not, last I checked. Get a grip and remember why you bought it in the first place. Unless you bought it specifically to make money quickly, then you were just, well, not thinking."
2025-08-28,“I hate Amazon because I bought at an all time high before earnings” 🤡
2025-08-28,"Then u should be grateful and bid again.

2025-08-28,"lol amateur. You buy and hold 5-10 years. If you can’t stomach it, sell and cut your losses and stop crying"
2025-08-29,Long term
2025-08-27,Maybe don’t buy at the all time high?
2025-08-27,im stuck bag holding idk what to do anymore im so cooked man
2025-08-28,lol good luck it will be trading at 220 in 5 years
2025-08-28,i know the patient are the investors who didnt buy amzn. if the s&p 500 today was anywhere near red amzn would be dwn 2-3%
2025-08-28,36 for me.  Bought at the Japan Yen carry trade panic.  Easy money.  Why would someone buy a billion shares at the height?

2025-08-27,i bought 1500 shares at 235. so im down a good 10k
2025-08-28,It’s gonna make other people in this sub happy. You are a whiny little bicht. You have made your dumb choice to buy Amazon without doing any analysis or having a plan everyone’s problem. All of us have to endure you.
2025-08-28,35% but you forgot to say its red as of right now while the s&p 500 is green
2025-08-27,"Dude, it is freaking amazon…it crashed to $80+ at 1 point now has recovered steadily since. Just delete ur app for a while and come back few months later"
2025-08-27,"Don’t invest in individual stocks if you can’t stomach periods of poor performance. IMO, Amazon is set up well for the next 5-10 years and will outperform. I don’t really care what it does on a day to day basis. If you do, then sell it or sell covered calls."
2025-08-28,Get help. Professional help. An entire team in Vienna or something. And sell your position. Daily posting on reddit helps nothing.
2025-08-27,Amazon has been in a heavy spend cycle the last few years; the next few years I believe Amazon will start to reward that capex spend to its shareholders with insane growth in revenue and income.
2025-08-28,"You're only down 3%. You've literally lost nothing on this. And if that 3% worth of $10k is too much, then you grossly miscalculated your investable funds. This is completely your own fault.

2025-08-26,Jeff selling too many shares for now. Stock will likely 3x as soon as he stops selling
2025-08-26,nah lmao stock is terrible if you look today its 5 year yield is 35%. if you invested in a hysa 5 years ago you make just as much almost with  no risk
2025-08-26,Teases us with $239.99 then back to $209
2025-08-26,"If you accept/believe that the market is driven by supply and demand, ie limit buys and limit sells… 

The limit buys (bottom of wedge) are getting closer to the limit sells (top of wedge) 

When they converge, it means that the limit sells are getting eaten up right away, so they no longer create resistance at the top of the wedge. 

What also happens is short covering once it has a small break above the resistance, which pushes price higher. Then you have fomo and momentum traders piling in. 

The counter argument, or reason this fails- is because leveraged options enable profits above and beyond the same amount of capital invested. This allows big players to shut down momentum- it costs them millions to move the underlying, but they can make billions via option bets"
2025-08-26,To be fair 5 years ago was a COVID pump that didn't last long
2025-08-26,Hmm thanks for the explanation it is helpful. The whole thing just screams confirmation bias to me. Especially as it requires the stock to be trending upwards in order to predict that the stock is going to continue to trend upwards.

2025-08-21,The fuck is buying Dell??
2025-08-23,"The reason isn't that interesting. Institutional managers often have maximum security weighting limits for their portfolio. So the benchmark might be the s&p500, but they might not be able to hold 7% of their entire portfolio in one stock even though NVDA is like 7% of the index right now. They're just being conservative, not bearish."
2025-08-20,NVDA is overvalued simple
2025-08-22,"What's hype about something like NVDA? Hear me out-- AI is absolutely a bubble, but the market is being held up by that bubble. Companies that make up a large portion of the S&P are relying on the story told by this bubble to maintain their stock prices. NVDA has something like 85% market share of the hardware used by the companies participating in the AI bubble. What I'm trying to say is, for as long as the market doesn't crash, NVDA will continue to rise. If the market does crash, everything else is going with it anyway."

2025-08-22,"That rings true. If the AI bubble is crashing that hard then Nvidia is going down with it, if it crashes a little bit less hard Nvidia is going down with it. I believe long term Nvidia is going down.

Doesn't of course change that I am investing in market ETFs, the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay short."
2025-08-24,"Intel has been doing this funny thing for a while where it never dips much below $19. And then it goes back up to mid 20s. Buying it in low 20s seems to get you a tidy profit. It’s been doing this for the last year. Not sure why this is, potentially because at those prices it’s trading either at or below book, so investors may think that the market is being overly pessimistic. Then people buy in, price goes back up, people sell."
2025-08-24,"PEG ratio is 1.7.  It's slightly higher than Google.  Palantir is 4.19.


Of course I don't understand the over-optimism.  Everyone is optimistic about AI, and things are priced that way, but people on Reddit think it will gain sentience and replace us entirely."
2025-08-24,Bullish
2025-08-24,"Yeah if you only evaluated by PEG and never bought anything above 1.5 you would have missed out on most the tech names for the past decade and been wrong.

NVIDIA may be overvalued after a comprehensive discounted cash flow modeling various outcomes but even then it’s hard to exactly project future earnings or discount rates.

All to be said valuation is not “simple” or I would implore you to short it."

2025-08-16,"Before earnings, I bought AMZN 240/265Cs expiring at the end of August.  I'm praying for a miracle"
2025-08-16,I'm exercising my 90 9/19/2025 call. This baby is about to blow. I want the shares
2025-08-16,"Lots of call open interest right now in the market. Be careful, Wrecktember is coming soon but a long dated call might not be a bad idea for the holidays"
2025-08-16,"I have a larger stake in AAPL than AMZN but it is eye opening the parallels that this sub and the AAPL sub have… Whenever the stock isn’t on an absolute tear, you get these degenerate, impatient clowns bitching and moaning about how the company is dying and the stock is going to crash $100+. It’s so annoying. 

If you believe in a company and think they will be successful and profitable over a long period, then invest in them. If you can’t take the short term dips, then get out of the kitchen."
2025-08-16,"That guy should be banned. He writes a post daily if Amazon is down .1% and talks like idiot ass zoomer kid. He did the same thing with Nvidia. He picks a stock and goes all in on it and if it doesn’t moon the next day he goes to that stocks subreddit and talks about how shit he was. 

Dude bought nvdia and it tanked. He non stop talked shit about Nvidia. Then it came back and he made a little money. Sold his entire position and then went 100% into Amazon lol."
2025-08-16,"Yeah. Most “investors” these days seem to have a very short time horizon, like single day almost. It’s no wonder 0DTE contracts are super popular."
2025-08-14,"Every time a storm is felt, money flows into Amazon because it is the most solid company in May 7. It has certainly performed worse in recent years, because everyone was enticed by easy profits and speculation, but now that the waters are murky it will provide satisfaction."
2025-08-14,Short term doesn’t matter but even over 5 years Amazon has underperformed. I’m heavily invested because Amazon is the best deal on the market right now if the stock price starts to reflect it - but it hasn’t yet.
2025-08-15,"And the market doesnt talk about the AD revenue, while goog ad revenue is in threat, Amazon ads will be a safe engine years to come."
2025-08-15,"Exactly. I do not understand fanboy blind worship of anything. But I guess that makes me very different than the average person who lives to worship politicians and churches and sports teams and their pet lizard and anything they get involved in at all. I probably have invested 10x what some of these schmucks have in Amazon … for 10x the years …. which is exactly why I have some god damn expectations. Amazon should be doing better, especially this year. They should be at 270 at least. Jassy is doing something wrong."
2025-08-15,"I think exactly like you. Amazon, for being a single stock, is already very diversified. E - commerce, cloud computing, advertising, AI, robotics, satellites, robo taxis. It is using the profits to expand its reach 360 degrees.

The price of the stock does not reflect its value, simply the irrationality of the market. But Amazon, in my opinion, is destined to dominate and in this period of uncertainty it is the only one that gives me a lot of peace of mind."
2025-08-15,Re: Meta—you’d prefer a company that earns 98% of revenue from ads from platforms could be obsolete in the next 10 years?
2025-08-15,"unlike amzn, meta is actually innovating with llama4 and v-jepa, generative video editing and massive data center investments.

Even if meta stayed stuck in the past and carried on focusing on ads forever, assuming that ads will become obsolete is wild af lmao."
2025-08-16,"You don’t think Amazon is making data center investments? The goal is to make AWS’s Bedrock the foundation for building AI agents. 

How is meta going to monetize its AI investments? As far as I can tell, they’re creating AI content to make their platforms more engaging in order to sell ads. Not a terrible model, but it’s risky. Will people still engage if it’s inundated with AI content?"
2025-08-16,"Not enough, and not nearly as innovative. AWS is lagging behind, despite a current larger market share than azure, and it's showing.

Meta monetizes AI already, via ad targeting and ad creation, improved chat bots and charging premium for ai tools, api access to closed models, metaverse ar/vr and way more. 

  
other than amzn's AWS growth slowing down, what else does amazon have to show for in embracing the AI sphere?"
2025-08-16,"Targeted ads (both internal and as a competitor to trade desk) and improvements to its logistics/shipping business, particularly with the use of robotics. It has multiple revenue streams affected by AI, met has one

And re your point on cloud, how is Azure’s growth rate evidence that AWS is falling behind on a tech or long term basis?

Its growth rate isn’t lower in spite of its larger share but rather BECAUSE it is larger."
2025-08-16,"ah yes, the old ""can't get bigger once you're too big"" trope. except everyone in the mag7 proves it wrong, except amzn, and except tsla which only god knows why it's still part of the mag group.

azure is gaining ground BECAUSE it's a driver in AI integration, unlike AWS. it's a hybrid cloud solution, unlike AWS. it's just  much more attractive to any enterprise, point blank period.

5 years of doing only half as good as the index is the final word here. we can keep talking about it till we're blue in the face, but 5 years of price movement tells the tale. had it been 1 or 2 years, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt. 5 is too long."
2025-08-16,"Did Amazon do something to you personally? The 5 year return is bad because it was overbought 5 years ago. Its underlying performance based on revenue and eps growth has been very good. I consider it fairly priced now with significant upside potential and a reasonable margin of safety. 

How do you know that Azure is a driver of AI integration and AWS is not?

Anyway, if you really feel this way, short the stock

2025-08-16,"lmao I'm not emotional about any stock, maybe you are. You seem adamant to try to defend a half-performing-as-index stock.

sooo RSI from 5 YEARS ago is why it's underperforming FOR 5 YEARS? lmaooooooooo

If its underlying performance was as good as you'd say, you know what would have reflected it? that's right, the stock price!

One thing I'd agree with you is it's fairly priced atm, and until further notice."
2025-08-13,"It’s an exhausting stock lately. And I say that as a long long holder. Good signals? It’s down. Bad signals? It’s way down. 

Every holder knows this and to be honest the head winds are becoming worse and worse."
2025-08-13,"Just buy and hold. You can’t be short sighted. 5 years is just a blip. Zoom out to see the bigger picture. You will be very happy in 10 years.

AMZN will be at $300. Then at $400. Just be patient. Sit back and chill. Go watch a movie. Go for a bike ride. Take a walk in the park. Love your family. 

When I was calling Facebook to be $300 back in 2014 people thought I was crazy. It’s $700+ now. I’ve realized to trust myself. 

When I was telling everyone to buy Palantir in the sub $20 price, people looked at me like I didn’t know anything. I took that opportunity to buy over 6500 shares. 5 years later I’m sitting on millions. 

Amazon is a solid company that’s super profitable. They are the unquestionable leader in cloud computing. They will overtake Nvidia in market cap. Do you Amazon wants to keep buying Nvidia products forever? They are a cutthroat company and will develop in house hardware for themselves. 

Patience, that’s it. 

2177 shares strong at an average of $81."
2025-08-12,"Chill, the Cpi is very good for retails. just look at the airlines going up 9%, well low rates for sure will pop up buying shit at amazon more then buying ai chips. we should be up in the end."
2025-08-13,It's red?
2025-08-13,I repeat: don’t bring that finance guy to the earnings to spell future doomsday. No one has the crystal ball. Report your earnings and stop guessing the future.
2025-08-13,Sell covered calls on your stock until it turns. P/E ratio is quite healthy
2025-08-14,Sometimes buying great companies is not enough. Sometimes you also have to buy them at a great price.
2025-08-12,"shits trash dude. i got stuck bagholding literally at 235. 225 (lol ion even thing it could get there) and im out ill take a 15k loss, worst investment ever"
2025-08-13,"The stock won’t go up everyday. If you can’t stomach a stock not moving or going down, then don’t check it. Better yet, just don’t buy."
2025-08-13,I agree. I took my profits from today's calls and I'm rolling them over into 592.5 VOO calls
2025-08-13,"81 dollars is a beautiful price. My average is 188. My frustration comes from holding calls. Long term, my profit with them is doing well"
2025-08-14,"Yeah I regret not doing that beforehand. My average buy in price was around 188, so I'm happy with my long-term return. 

I'll just avoid doing any options with them."
2025-08-13,"Buy high, sell low. 👍🏻"
2025-08-13,Investment? You weren’t in very long and got played brotha go do something else with your time.
2025-08-13,Stop gambling and start investing. The stock was at 235 this year 🤦‍♀️ If you’re gonna sell that quick just go to the casino and get it over with
2025-08-15,Oh wow. It went up 2% and is still below where it was pre earnings. What moves.
2025-08-17,Bought the bulk of shares in 2017 at $1215 (pre-split; $60.75/share adjusted for split) and watched it bleed daily. Then still bought yearly but averaged up to $81/share.
2025-08-14,"Don’t sell it now, it will go to 265 in less than 6 months. Then sell it for anything except Tesla. Microsoft nvidia meta google alphapjets etc do research and check markets sentiment. Buy the dips.."
2025-08-13,"We cant be stuck forever, there will be a break in the stock price above 250 soon."
2025-08-13,That’s fair. It’s a rigged game. I’m a long-term investor. I’m up over 60%. There’s no way I could do stuff like calls or day trade or short.  I just don’t have the time!
2025-08-13,I'll report back 🫡
2025-08-15,"Sell them, I will buy."
2025-08-13,"To be fair, I was up well over 100% on my calls. I just got greedy and ended up selling for only 25% Profit instead.

Long term is the way"
2025-08-13,Sell out or short it then. by 2030 Amazon will have a trilion dollar in revenue and close to 200 billion net income. this makes amzn a 10 p/e if you buy it now. and it will not have a 10 pe then it will have 30 this means 200% upside for the next five years. thats my 2 cent.
2025-08-13,guess ur right. holding it is!
2025-08-10,"This will be huge in 2026, market being very ignorant about the explosive ad revenue growth and only cry about aws not growing fast as azure, we will see 3 trillion market cap soon."
2025-08-10,Hold on.  Will be rewarded soon
2025-08-11,It hasn’t even beaten the S&P500 over the last 5 years.. it’s a dog compared to its peers
2025-08-12,How many shares you got? You buying at this price?
2025-08-11,"Not a genie but i do see margins going up and we will get noticed by the street, dont know when but need will make it. If they switch CEO that will also help."
2025-08-12,My average is 200… and I own couple of hundreds
2025-08-08,"This has also been an expensive company for 5 years. However, you could have bought this on pullbacks like tariff scare at $170. It was trading under 25x earnings. And you’d have a decent return. I think we can expect revenue growth across amazons lines of businesses and margins to continue to expand. This should support and even propel the stock going forward. Now, if we see another pullback, its long term returns will only improve for those that understand the thesis."
2025-08-09,What a loser. Sorry you are bad at this.
2025-08-09,"If you don't have patience, don't invest in individual comapnies, it takes more than a decade to outperform index funds...Amazon is a quality company, if you hold it enough"
2025-08-09,"Every person I know uses Amazon for all kinds of stuff. They have a subscription model for prime.  Subscription stocks like NFLX, SPOT and COST have done great and that doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Yes AWS is lagging other competitors. It’s not a core holding for me but I definitely want to stay in. They will benefit in multiple ways with AI. They can further automate and optimize which lowers costs and you gotta think AWS can only go up. Once tariffs settle down and if the consumer gets stronger we’ll see where they go. But now is not the time to back away."
2025-08-09,"Yep, I’m gonna sell covered calls until this thing gets taken away from me. I’m done with it."
2025-08-09,I’ll buy your shares
2025-08-09,"I don't think your temperament fits as a long term investor in individual stocks. 

If you want to create long term wealth with a high degree of certainty, I would switch to globally diversified, low cost index funds. If you want to have fun and excitement with much lower odds of long term success, consider trading more volatile names with money you can afford to lose.

For Amazon specifically, the business fundamentals have improved massively over 5 years. The price hasn't moved much because the valuation went from very lofty to reasonably cheap. Operating income has a pathway to grow 20% per year for a while, which will reward those patient enough to stick through the boredom."
2025-08-10,"The dividends more than make up for it, he said, sarcastically."
2025-08-09,This stocks stinks so bad! All their growth prospects  suck!!! I’ll never sell any of my shares!!!
2025-08-09,"amzn is one of the more exposed stocks out there in regards to tariffs, you're fault for holding on to it."
2025-08-09,Can you imagine if they reduced Capex by 20%?
2025-08-09,lol you are just a bad investor. Sell the stock and go buy HIMS or PLTR and best of luck
2025-08-09,Investing involves the risk of loss
2025-08-09,"Bad day here too. S&P up to record height, but everything I own was a loser: Lily, Capital One, ANET, AMD, PANW. I thought Tech was safe right now!!"
2025-08-09,"I bought it high 212. I'm holding it long term. Doing better than BRK.B and WM. It all depends at what price you bought it for, I think."
2025-08-09,Is that what Bezos sold all his shares?
2025-08-09,"Zoom out. AMZN is up 768% for the past 10 years vs the S&P500 223.42%, 10,330% vs 423.58% for the past 20 years. Just because you bought it at the recent highs doesn’t mean it’s a dogshit stock. 

I do agree however that you should be sticking to the S&P500 instead of any individual stock if you can’t handle the risk of underperforming the index which most investors will be likely to do so."
2025-08-10,"Yes long term it should be good (cloud, AI, space, grasp of e-commerce share). They are building for the long run."
2025-08-10,"I’m not seeing what you’re seeing. I have a relatively small position of only 290 shares and since I acquired it in July 20, 2021, I’m up almost 80% (exercised options at a strike price around $125/share). So if you average that across 4 years since were close to Aug 20, 2025, that’s almost 20% a year average. Even if you bought it at the going rate in July/Aug 2021, for comparison purposes, that’s approximately $165/share and now it’s at $222/share so that’s almost 9% a year which is good for a blue chip stock like AMZN.

Not to be a dick but I’m thinking you’re either relatively new to investing or just young or both. If you’re either new or young then you are only used to a market that’s just been printing money since Covid and that’s not reflective of how the market typically works so you need to get it out of your head that the market will always go up by 10%+ every single year in perpetuity. It just doesn’t work that way."
2025-08-10,"This is one of your posts from 71 days ago where you said you sold Nvidia at $140 and made numerous posts complaining about it. Nvidia is currently at $182. Yeah you definitely need to just buy SPY and only ever put money into that because clearly you don’t know jack about investing in individual companies.

https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/s/DCQj991YB9"
2025-08-10,I sell continuously cash secured puts. Earn money and buy cheaper. 🙂
2025-08-13,Every company has their highs and lows. This one made me three times millionaire 10 years ago. It is still ok to hold some in my humble opinion but it won't be a skyrocket kinda stock anymore. The growth phase is done
2025-08-13,"It’s where you buy man! My average price is $130
I averaged up from under $100.  $AMZN gives you twice the opportunity then the S&P for dip buys"
2025-08-08,lol im out for good. once i break even my money is going into the s&p 500. this stock has been a true depression catalyst. i haven't even done anything cuss im so afraid this thing will bottom out to 160 like last august
2025-08-09,Also a good pullback during Yen carry trade scare.
2025-08-09,I'm new to Amazon because I've always thought it was overpriced but after looking into it more deeply i think it was around fair value to possibly a bit undervalued at 210 so I started my position. If it goes to 170$ and under i will be buying heavy. I don't get why people are so negative here it's an amazing business that has great future potential.
2025-08-09,"dogshit stock. 230 is fine, pos can't even get there. ill sell at 230  7.5K loss at least. ill make it back up in the s&p 500 index."
2025-08-09,You have to take into account the massive amount of money being spent for ai upgrades. All of the Mag 7 (or 8) have been investing in upgrades that will be reflected in future performance.
2025-08-08,"right, but it was trading at 185 a year before? so you really can't time the market. The conclusion is AMZN on a 5 year basis is a bad stock"
2025-08-09,"Why wait for break even? That’s a completely arbitrary number that has no impact on the investment. If it’s in a retirement account there’s no impact at all. If it’s in a taxable account, you can realize a loss and write off against income and or other realized gains. 

You should base your investment decisions based on what you think the best investment is today and moving forward. If you think it doesn’t have good prospects then sell. Breaking even makes literally no difference and the stock price doesn’t care what your cost basis is."
2025-08-10,Now I actually consider buying in.
2025-08-11,"It’s mostly retail business revenue, which has very low margins.

Why did it enter into the cloud security space? Cause Bozo said there was no competition because margins were low. Fast forward to today, and AWS has…. Low margins!

Now we have the AI race, and Jassy is skimping by developing in-house GPUs. Whaaaaaaat?

We need Bozo back. Ditch Lauren"
2025-08-11,"Yes there is competition, but a rising tide is going to lift all ships. A friend at Microsoft described azure as the highest quality offering, but it’s also very expensive. Aws is the less expensive and potentially most robust offering. The rest of the competitors are in the periphery at the moment. And it is common for customers to blend cloud offerings making them customers of more than one cloud provider."
2025-08-09,Edit:  OP is an *unstable moron
2025-08-09,"You do know the day after you sell it will go to the moon, right?. Just leave it alone. More people lose more money because they mess around with their portfolios too much more than almost anything else. I've had stocks down for  a long time only for them to recover and double. It's broken stocks, not a broken company. And there's a huge difference between the two."
2025-08-09,"i’ve said it before, but Amazon leadership doesn’t care about its investors. Tim Cook, that’s a guy who cares about his investors."
2025-08-09,Sell covered calls
2025-08-09,"it's 40% gain from 5 years ago....yes not like the S&P 500 which gained almost 100%...

Just because a company does not outperform the S&P 500 isn't a bad stock.  It's just growing ""slower"".

What made you invest in amazon in the first?  That's what you should question yourself."
2025-08-09,Increased earnings and profits leading to a higher share price.  The tradeoff is risk of increased dominance from Walmart. Tariffs have leveled the playing field for Chinese competitors
2025-08-11,Watching two losers have a useless internet argument 👌🏼 core reddit
2025-08-09,"L move on my end. i should have done my research. im done 20k, but if at least rebounds to 230 i can take a 7.5k loss and leave for good. individual stocks aren't worth it"
2025-08-09,i took the risk of it having a good AWS number and obviously it crashed from 235 to 211 so i mean it was a risk i took. at least it isnt options where i immediately lost it. there is still hope for amzn to go to 235 again and i break even
2025-08-09,"To me it's a timeline. 

Just to preface this, I'd never heard of NVDA. I went to College with a guy who I grew up with. College roommate and best friend, but he was so humble, when I'd ask how things were going, he'd just say, 'eh, alright, just working as a financial advisor.' 

Never wanted to give strong advice, just... ""I like these, but you could let it ride in VIG."" That's a quote.

  
Well, long story short, I inherited money, I thought just buying as much rental property as I could and putting all of it back in so I could build 80-100 or more units was the best way to make money. So started with 3M(Gramps was a baller who was a co-founder of a company that's still listed, though they'd lost about 70% of their value by this point as they were a printing company... and it's ALL he ever had his stock in). 

  
But 2015 this friend starts telling me, ""Buy NVDA. Every spare penny, buy it, I don't know when, but it's going to take off... it's going to 3X, 4X(he wasn't that insightful). Early 2019, I ask if he still likes NVDA and he said with Covid and the worker supply, I think AI is going to accelerate, I like it now more than ever. 

  
So I sold a property, bought 1500 shares at 230 a share. 

Watched it split into 6,000 shares, split and then start climbing again until it lost \~60% of it's value. But still, I was well up. 6,000 shares at 120(roughly the low before the last split}) was better than 1500 at 230... but he was still bullish, but he told me two more things. 

BUY AVGO NOW and then 'buy AMZN, take every dividend, every extra dollar, invest in AMZN for the next 15 years."" 

  
Those were his 3 pieces of advice. 

He then sent me a their research on their top tech stocks. He was a Sr VP and manages 1.5B. 

  
So I sold everything and just started to listen to him without any doubt, bought 1200 more shares at 400. Bought 5000 shares of AMZN and 9470 of AVGO....as well as others like TSM, META, MSFT... not TSLA. He also told me he liked PLTR, but it was early... I missed it. 

  
ANYWAY....

I bought AMZN at around 100 when I started selling my rental properties and I bought 5000 shares. I've been buying every time I saved 500 bucks, every time I got 500 bucks for Dividends. I bought at 240, I bought at 160, I bought before earnings and I just bought after earnings. 

  
I get it's frustrating, but they'll increase their AI capex and they'll grow AWS...and they will KEEP dominating in EVERY other area. 

They haven't even started to REALLY try and make money. They've been building out the infrastructure of this massive corporation and they're still doing it.

  
Live sports, they're going to have robotics, they're going to deliver things by drone in an hour, FSD delivery trucks, quantum computing, I know their Chips are holding them back and they're being stubborn, but I'll bet they spend their way into figuring that out. 

  
This is a company that has made nearly 800B the last 4 Quarters. And sure, the margins aren't great, but... they will improve and they will HIT 1T IN ANNUAL REVENUE in the next couple years and they're going to slow their CapEx at some point and margins will come up. And when they're sitting here with 1.5T in revenue and 500B in revenue in 2035, it'll be NVDA or AMZN for the world's more valuable company(TSM will be up there, but not THERE). 

  
Just... my opinion. Take it or leave it..."
2025-08-09,"In the $150s. $157ish I think. Anyway, the point is that price action is not a reasonable reason to have or lose conviction. That said, if that is the reason for your conviction, then S&P500 may be a better place for your money."
2025-08-09,reported
2025-08-09,Did you only invest in 1 stock? You can't just invest in 1 individual stock and expect more than that.
2025-08-09,So basically you have a very short term investment time horizon. I hope you find what you’re looking for.
2025-08-11,What does your friend say to buy next?
2025-08-09,"You better report me yeah. 

Little man."
2025-08-09,no its long term actually. but i want to shift to the s&p 500. amzn has underperformed it for the past 5 years
2025-08-12,"Amazon.

No, seriously, he has said PANW...or cyber security. He really did say keep buying AMZN. TSM Also...but those are hardly under the radar. But he thinks the next real growth will be in security. 

He's been saying it for a while, but...that was more when pressed, but nothing he's offering up.

I also asked about the matket. It feels overbought to me. It was maybe 2 weeks ago that I saw this, bit it was 9 of the previous 10 weeks institutions had taken out a net of 1B more than they put in(at least). So retail had been driving the market.

I asked if HE thought we were going to have a recession and if I should have more money on the sideline.

He said ""recession already happened, earnings validated that, we're on our way back out, not in.""

So... IDK, he's looking at it from a different perspective and over a 20 year time span. He rarely has a stock he believes in that much.

His advice seems like Buffett if he was more tech heavy and didn't mind higher valuations."
2025-08-11,"They may seem to be now, but AI hasn't even really started. We have smarter search engines and cloud computing and that's about it. We'll see when we get to autonomous delivery trucks, drones, workers. They may be able to staff a warehouse with actual...robots. 

  
Terrible for humanity, but it'll be great for robotics. And sure, all the research reports he gives me now talk about AWS, but... they're SO big and involved in SO much, I don't think there's a shot they ""lose"" in the long run. 

  
I own META and MSFT... but just a couple hundred of each. I don't believe he's wrong on AMZN, I think when you zoom out, he'll be right. 

  
AMZN is just too dominant."
2025-08-09,"My cost basis is 24. If you are a long term investor and the thesis and reasons for owning it still matches up, you can own a stock for decades. Think long term."
2025-08-09,"Because if you don't post your personal portfolio on Reddit to validate the opinions of others, I don't believe it!

Also, you REALLY expect me to believe you've been invested in AMZN for a year and a half(roughly)?

No....no. People did NOT start investing in AMAZON until just when I started investing in it!

There's... no SHOT someone has a...LOL...150 dollar Price on Amazon!

Sorry, I'm definitely not mocking you... that's a good investment and I just went into a whole diatribe about how I've been given three pieces of advice from my College Roommate who is now SR VP at MS and manages 1.5B.

\-It was Buy NVDA starting in 2015(didn't listen.  
\-Buy AVGO(this was more 2023 when he was all in on AI and... just saw it coming).

\-Buy AMZN with whatever money you have left over and don't ever stop... you'll never lose money, you may be temporarily down, but AMZN is going to be the largest company in America by the time our kids are adults(his are 5-8).

I know he's got about 400,000 shares of NVDA, 100,000 of AMZN and then he gave me a ""watch out for PLTR"" back when it was 7 a share and I don't know how many shares, but I'm guessing it's tens of thousands of that as well.

Kids flipping burgers and doing tricks at Wendy's and he can't imagine there are people who make more in the world.

I mean, I'm sure the card tricks he's doing by Wendy's are really good(is this your card) but there are levels to this.

Don't assume you need to be on everyone else's level and don't assume nobody can be above yours."
2025-08-09,Dude you actually are unstable. Wasn’t expecting that.
2025-08-09,"Are you serious? Why would that POSSIBLY be hard to believe? I bought my first 5000 shares at 103. 

My DCA is probably...120 now as I've KEPT adding to it, but...157 is like 6 months ago. How new to investing are you that you think that's impressive?

LOL... I bought 1500 shares of NVDA at 230 in 2019/2020. That's TWO splits ago and a \~5.70 DCA and then I bought another 1200 at 400 in '23...ONE split ago. My DCA on NVDA is all told is about 11.50. 

  
And you think 150 on AMZN is crazy?

Dude, you realize AMD was just in the 70s? NVDA just in the 80s. 

  
Hell, AMAN was just like... 150 15 months ago or so. You must really be new to trading."
2025-08-08,"$240,  Jan 16 2026"
2025-08-08,"AMZN needs to continue to hold this 212, but it it can go under 212, I can see AMZN hitting low 200s. If AMZN goes above 230, I truly believe we can see a clean shot back into 240 🫡"
2025-08-08,imo by end of the month unless there is negative news with tariffs/fed interest rate
2025-08-08,I think we would've hit 230 today if we didn't tank late yesterday. I'm holding 8/22 220 calls
2025-08-09,i have always noticed that AMZN lags recovery on price while all other tech rally much more. most other have reached All Time Highs while AMZN lags
2025-08-07,100% tariffs on Semiconductors baby!!
2025-08-07,"Markets are so reactive.  Take a chill pill while the fixer in charge babbles away. 

Where is the list btw? Do yall think President Netanyahu would allow him to pardon Maxwell?"
2025-08-07,"My guess is that news came out that caused an outflow from ETFs that hold AMZN, and the resulting dip was immediately corrected by direct buyers since AMZN wasn’t affected by that bit of news.

Maybe Bezos sold a huge chunk of his shares, and HFT machines immediately bought them up to the original price.

Most likely, though, the market reacted strongly to something and quickly changed their minds."
2025-08-07,I tried to buy shares and robinhood was not allowing my trade to be placed
2025-08-09,Some idiot placed a market sell order AH and it got filled at 211? 😂
2025-08-05,"With all this sad. Why do most analysts rate as a buy or strong buy. This may be a dumb question, but are they in kahoots with the whales?"
2025-08-05,"this stock was in the $160 range months ago, the only reason it was that low was because of tariffs. It was over $220 before the tariff stuff happened and it went down too that point because of the numbers from the last earnings. This stock hasnt shot up since before its stock split years ago and moves at a snails pace when it moves up. This company shoot’s themselves in the foot with the release of weak guidances even though they have beat expectations in the past year."
2025-08-05,"Nobody knows, but I have seen bullish options trades posted on X."
2025-08-05,"Like any stocks when there are signs that you are at the bottom thats probably not the bottom yet, otherwise buying side would have caught up. The chance that retail investors can see and act before turning has occurred is not high imho."
2025-08-05,Hopefully $190
2025-08-05,"This is where we’re at, imagine if we go into a recession lol. Back to $80

But real talk until AWS surprises or they manage to do more automation to improve retail margins I doubt we see anything good"
2025-08-06,A lot of investors think they are solid in the long run. This is temporary.
2025-08-05,I might sell this shit stock tbh
2025-08-04,this stock has moved up at a snail pace since its stock split and has crashed down after earnings for awhile now
2025-08-05,What are yall price target?
2025-08-09,Guess Amazon employees has to force people in the office 6 days a week now. That should boost their stock price
2025-08-05,For like every earnings in a row
2025-08-06,Honestly because it is Amazon.  It by its nature has to outperform in the long run.  Right?
2025-08-06,My biggest reason for owning Amazon stock is because I'm so in love with being able to order almost everything I need and having it outside my door in a day or 2. That's why I bought it and that's why I'm probably just gonna continue to hold.
2025-08-05,I will be holding my Amazon stock. I believe there is future upside.
2025-08-06,"Unfortunately, I bought in at $231 when it was high, and then it tanked. I’ve set a sell order at my purchase price, but I have no idea how long it’ll take… I’m done with this stock too"
2025-08-05,"Sounds like a good time to buy then, when people are hating usually is near the bottom."
2025-08-05,Yeah even the tarrifs are priced in already. That's assuming Trump doesn't change his mind again 
2025-08-04,"To take a page from Aswath Damodaran, Apple is acting its age. Its DNA of innovation has long been exhausted. It’s true identity is supply chain and logistics. They don’t have the ability to change their identity, especially with Tim Cook at the helm. Even if they swap CEOs, Apple’s ship is too big to change course. The best they can do is return value to its investors. Buybacks and dividends will be their game. Incremental improvements to their existing hardware suite and software ecosystem, and pray for a long ride to corporate retirement."
2025-08-04,"I don’t think they would, but Apple could buy anthropic for about what they’ve run single share buyback campaigns for"
2025-08-05,OP you forgot $MSFT
2025-08-07,"So you seem to be saying: $AAPL based on its investments in AI is not a first mover. Hence the stock is less valuable?

- Did apple have the fire phone, music player, (…)
- Could apple have such a strong brand that they jump on AI later and integrate it into their products better than anyone else?
- Has the oracle sold off $AAPL in huge portions yet?"
2025-08-04,"Apple is a consumer goods company. 

I innovate with the M1 Chips and that made the battery of their laptops eternal.

They do not have to pursue every new business opportunity and will surely obtain more value for shareholders in the future.

Greetings"
2025-08-06,"These are a lot of big words with not a lot of real value in them. AAPL can very well change course, but the only reason they don’t is because they want to be the second mover after it has been proven that a product is needed by most people. Making an extra billion does not live needlessly at Apple scale. There is absolutely no proof that all those $100B of investment will ever generate trillions in revenue that the market believes in. Maybe it will by replacing some jobs (maybe), but that’s not really Apple’s market. 

AAPL never went into search, social media, or retail. Why should they go deep into AI? IMO, the proofreading feature they added is a great AI use. Another thing they can do is with the Photos app, aggregate images by time, location, something else, etc. Siri is another huge area to improve, but I don’t see why it can’t be done in the next update. They do not run infrastructure like all other big tech that they need to build data centers and use 100s of Bs."
2025-08-06,"Buying Anthropic outright would likely cost upwards of 300b - if they even sold. They are a public benefit corporation so AAPL would probably need to make concessions. 

OpenAI would be even more on the open market, and there isn't really anyone else that could put AAPL close to parity, so at this point they are just... too far behind with no way to catch up in a reasonable time frame"
2025-08-07,There were rumours they would buy Mistral.
2025-08-06,Exactly. You can get Ai on your iPhone without Apple throwing billions in AI investment. And they get a cut. Nvda sells chips. Apple isn’t going to be selling AI chips. Google amzn msft are renting out time on their Ai servers. AAPL is not in that business.
2025-08-06,"You’re free to have your opinion, and you could very well be correct. However, they haven’t showed any growth levers for a very long time. The ear buds, the watches, and the goggles are just incremental products. Their phone is now a commodity. Their App Store is being scrutinized by the FTC. Their supply chain in China is at risk.

Unless they show something, you’re speculating on more mysticism than I am."
2025-08-08,"I largely agree that they are more of a “wait and watch” and then “do it far better than anyone imagined” company. 

However, the big risk is OpenAI’s acquisition of Jony Ive’s design company. OpenAI is likely going to be the go-to LLM app for most people, especially as they add variety in the tone, mood, and languages they offer AND they add integrations with other apps like Gmail and Google Calendar. 

If my life is partially run by an LLM (GPT-X), it’s only a matter of time a device comes along that integrates this LLM into every single thing. Apple imagined a phone without keypad, but largely, phone design didn’t evolve after that. Sure, cameras have gotten much better but that’s pretty much it. 

I do think someone like a Tim Cook has and is thinking about this. Maybe he’s operating in stealth- who knows?

Personally, I’m excited about what the next frontier of human-machine interaction will look like. "
2025-08-07,"I agree. Nothing is 100% certain. However, for every Microsoft you have many more companies that are slowly dying because the lack of agility. 

My assumption for Apple is that they lack the ability to be agile. While Microsoft was willing to try many different things, even failing at some ventures, Apple just doesn’t have any new growth curves. Apple has been buying back stock to the tune of $700 billion over the last 5 years. They couldn’t think of anything besides a $3500 goggle that Meta already has for $500?

Until they bring in a new CEO with a new culture, I just don’t see them keeping up with Big Tech peers."
2025-08-05,"I guess we don’t know what the ai revenue model of the future will be but right now, no one is going to pay Apple to use their llm."
2025-08-06,"It doesn’t matter if they have “good” products. Their revenue growth has flat lined for 4 years straight. Majority of their customers are cycling phones/computers slower and are not buying every new iteration. 

They have plateaued their growth curve. They have squeezed the bulk of the juice. Unless they come up with something drastically new, they’ll be on chapter 8 of their 10 chapter story. Just like how intel has managed to stay alive despite eroding business metrics for 20 years, the last two chapters for apple can last for many years to come.

Life cycles of businesses are measured in decades, not in days. Apple’s glory days are behind them as it is now. Even their behavior proves my point. Buybacks and dividends are extremely high for Apple. That is behavior when the company has no idea how to deploy it internally, especially when they’re buying back stock in the 100s of billions for the last 5+ years."
2025-08-02,I think Amazon is fairly priced with an opportunity to outperform if you’re patient 
2025-08-02,"I bought shares in AMZN on the dip, and plan to buy more in the future"
2025-08-02,Buying lots and lots of calls. Always long AMZN
2025-08-05,Buy AMZN on the Dip? WTF how about buying ORCL and catch a ride on their 🚀
2025-08-08,"Gents, Don’t be one of those investors , like the ones that stayed out of the dot.com boom because it “looked overpriced ”—missing years of real gains,3 years to be exact"
2025-08-03,"Would like to get other opinions on this, am not the most knowledgeable investor. I'm concerned about further investing in amazon long term due to AWS. It dropped around 8% the night before the entire market went down because of concerns about AWS growth and long term vision for it despite comfortably beating earnings predictions. With azure growing so much I'm really concerned about it continuing to drop going forward to the next earnings if AWS continues to show slowing growth and azure continues to grow. Anyone got thoughts on this? I have around £5k in shares so I'm not hating, just echoing what I've been reading elsewhere."
2025-08-05,Why are we talking about AMZN??  ORCL is blowing their doors off ! along with other Mag 7 inmates !! The run up to earnings will be interesting especially if they are involved with the purchase of TIK TOK!!!!
2025-08-05,The same guy was telling 70$ is fair for NVDA
2025-08-07,I would buy Shopify or Spotify. Amazon is acting like Apple trading sideways.  I think because of the Boycott
2025-08-06,Who out of interest? They’re performed poorly compared to the other mag7 in the last 4-5 years
2025-08-06,Good idea
2025-08-08,good advice
2025-08-06,There are many stocks you can buy right now that you can make money on. why are you so fixated on AMZN? Come back to it when it gets its momentum back. Simple
2025-08-06,"Really, soul .....  I am trying to invest my hard earned money and have it grow for my families benefit.  Good luck with your ethical journey."
2025-08-06,Why? Give me a good reason and I will.
2025-08-07,"I'm not ""so fixated"" on amazon, I have 8x the amount of shares in google than I do amazon. Not sure how you came to that conclusion from a question."
2025-08-13,"Cause it’s going down, Netflix, RDDT or TJX is a better investment"

2025-08-01,"Stocks during earning calls are pure hype from investors not rational thoughts, once people come to their senses in a few weeks Amazon will increase"
2025-07-31,"AMZN is not a short-term, pump and dump type of stock.

It’s likely going to continue to grow exponentially in the next decade or two. It’s a long-term investment."
2025-07-30,"I get it, but if you look at the core business and how much money they have been spending on the back end/alongside bezos selling. They are actually under valued imo. Its about 30 percent of my portfolio, usually amazon stagnats for a bit before the heavy revenue comes in and the stock rises"
2025-07-30,"Shit. I bought that thing at like $1,000!"
2025-07-31,"The 5 year window has indeed been weak. Basically just tracking 8% YOY. For mega cap tech peers, that’s poor performance. If you zoom out to 10 year view, looks much better. But 5 years is a long investment window for some not to see blockbuster results particularly if you’re not a believer in the core business (Bezos is evil etc.) Anyway I have $800k of the stuff. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
2025-08-01,"All in all, buying great companies is not always enough to get a great return. You also have to buy them at good prices."

2025-07-30,"shits trash, i bought 1500 shares @ 233 and im down like 5k in a day. its been underperforming the market the past 5 years, at that point the s&p 500 index fund is safer and more rewarding than AMZN. i rather take the L now before it really dumps after earnings"
2025-07-31,How does an idiot like you even have the money for 1500 shares? 
2025-08-02,"You’re sitting on a goldmine! With 1500 shares, you can sell weekly covered calls. Since you said “yesterday”, I’m guessing you bought in at around $230. The $235 covered call for next week pays $21. You can sell 15 of them for $315 in a week which is a 4.7% annualized return even if the stock goes down. 

And that’s a bad week at that. When it starts going up again at the end of the year, you can easily make 1% a week just in premiums. Assuming you paid ~$345k, that’s $3,450 a week (~$180k annually). You know how many people would kill for that kind of income?"
2025-07-31,I was kinda joking. My 4 digit buys were pre-split. I’m long AMZN

2025-07-31,"You really shouldn’t sweat the short term results so much, unless you’re in this as a quick trade (aka a gamble).  If you bought as a long term investment and you believe in the company’s growth, then today’s return or even tomorrow’s earnings are unlikely to be enough to change your thesis."

only using bollinger is not a strategy. you have to have a confluence of multiple factors to suggest a buy/hold/sell signal (macd breakout divergence, rsi in the green, volume favoring buyer side, obv raking up, ema crossover, etc)"
