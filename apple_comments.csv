2025-10-18,"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/iphone-air-production-to-be-cut-amid-lower-sales/

>  The Japanese investment banking and securities firm claims that the iPhone 17 Pro and ‚ÄåiPhone 17 Pro‚Äå Max are seeing higher sales than their predecessors during the same period last year, while the standard iPhone 17 is a major success, performing significantly better than the iPhone 16.
> 
> The ‚ÄåiPhone Air‚Äå is apparently the outlier; Apple plans to reduce production by one million units this year. Meanwhile, Apple plans to increase production of all other models by two million units. The overall production forecast of the ‚ÄåiPhone 17‚Äå series this year has also been increased from 88 million units to 94 million units for the start of 2026.

Seriously are you okay?"
2025-10-19,It‚Äôs all good I see tons of 17 Pro out there including myself
2025-10-18,Bahahaha.  Show your short position.
2025-10-16,"it depends if the ai siri flops or not. if it's well received going from 250-300+ could happen very quickly. add fold, add home, add glasses, table top robot. the stock coiled this year. lots of reasons to be bullish next year."
2025-10-16,"I don¬¥t see any reasons that AAPL could break into $5T. 

AAPL is the second worst performer after AMZN among Mag7 YTD. 

Apple has not even surpassed ATH $260 from last year while all Mag7s have already crushed ATH from last year.   
I don¬¥t see any narratives how AAPL could gain like NVDA or even AMD from now on. 



Since 2013:

GOOGL 1256%

Amazon 1752%

Meta 2635%

Netflix 9146%.

Apple 1095%.

TSLA, NVDA, AMD and AVGO were either mid cap stocks or barely large caps at the time

NVDA 53598%, TSLA 14619%, AVGO 10246% and AMD 6059%.

  
As you see, AAPL has had a nice run since 2013, but others are better.

Now, teach me how AAPL could perform better than these others suddenly to surpass $5T market cap?"
2025-10-16,as long as it can hold on to the $200/share mark without dipping below until the next CEO i will consider it an achievement
2025-10-17,"Jobs increased market cap by 13,900% while Cook did 966%. Obviously different eras, but those numbers really put things in perspective. The question isn't really whether Apple can reach $5 trillion, it's whether they can find that next massive growth driver. Services revenue has been solid but it's not revolutionary.

Been thinking about this a lot as I rebalance my portfolio. The credit limit approach through platforms like Tiger actually makes it easier to move quickly when opportunities come up, especially during these uncertain times when you want to stay nimble but not miss out."
2025-10-20,respectfully i'm curious if you think this is a good way to spend your precious time on earth thinking about this or do you think maybe it would be better to decide to live your life and do whatever you want instead of being caught up with up and down shares
2025-10-17,"I know this is aapl sub and not Apple sub, but Apple literally has no competition, if you‚Äôre in the ecosystem, you‚Äôre not suddenly going to get surface tablets, where as if you‚Äôre in the Vivo ecosystem.. you very well MIGHT make the switch!

Apple has done just fine without chasing, slow and steady wins the race, we don‚Äôt need the CEO thinking he needs to become a sellout in order to put numbers up.. remember Tesla can‚Äôt give away a damn car, but the stock looks as though they‚Äôre the #1 car maker.  

Let‚Äôs not sellout to put numbers up in a certain time frame, slow and steady wins the race.  This is forever hold, set it and forget it territory .. a single stock being treated like an ETF, we like that! üî•üî•üî•"
2025-10-16,"Apple is late to ai, yet they their stock price remained relatively ok in the past years.  
With M5 (just released), it's clear that they are focusing on locally running ai models.  
I believe next year they will do more significant ai improvements which have good chances of boosting the stock price.  
Also they might release smart glasses according to rumors.  

Even if they won't reach $5T, I expect a big price jump next year."
2025-10-15,Never sell aapl
2025-10-15,"Hold. Best company on the planet. Solid products , great pipeline of products, good subscription services, more cash than you can fill a bank with. Top tier management."
2025-10-15,"It's pretty much a guarantee that eventually AAPL will hit $300+. I could see it dipping into the $220s before then, but this definitely isn't the all-time peak for Apple."
2025-10-15,"It's in the cusp of greatness and if you sell, you gonna regret it. AAPL is one good AI news away from skyrocketing.. it's one of the lowest performer of MAG 7 (other than AMZN). Brewing for a catalyst.

HODL my friend."
2025-10-15,Never sell
2025-10-15,Berkshire Hathaway still has AAPL as there #1 holding by far. I think I would hold on to it. I have owned it since 2013 and have done very well with it.
2025-10-16,"I wouldn‚Äôt sell. They‚Äôll always be relevant. I also think the 17 iphone is selling pretty well and short term results will be super strong. People will be surprised. Anyone complaining on lack of AI or bland product refreshes are clueless. What do you want, a triangle iPad? They are notorious for being slow to the punch but execute well. On the AI front, hard truth is there is likely a bubble. It‚Äôs a buzz word. Mass adoption of AI is a long term play at best. And even still, that‚Äôs a broad definition."
2025-10-15,I sold about $30K (original investment $4K) for using as downpayment on a house. But hoping to add more once I have some reserves again
2025-10-15,"Wait till it at least hits 255 again. TACO will happen and the price will recover. Plus earnings is coming up end of the month. Who knows what will happen, but price could jump after earnings."
2025-10-16,"If you have your house purchase date set, you can buy a put and sell a call close to that date and ought to be able to effectively sell AAPL for a guaranteed price that is higher than what it is now, at the cost of not participating in a major upside if that happens (but you will probably be able to participate in something like a 3-5% gain if that happens)"
2025-10-16,"Sell if you need the money: Like when I put the down payment on my townhome, when I went 6 months unemployed and selling AAPL helped us stay a float. But if nothing like that is coming your way‚Ä¶. HODL!"
2025-10-15,"There is no good alternative to it yet, I don‚Äôt think Windows would ever come close to os and the same with Android. The internal workings of macos is pretty containerized. 
Holding it till something better comes up."
2025-10-15,"Don‚Äôt sell, but If u are on a fence or needed money like I did then sell a portion and keep most of it."
2025-10-15,Apple is my buddy might sell in another decade
2025-10-15,Hold. For years.
2025-10-17,"To the never-sellers: sorry, but AAPL threw my portfolio completely off track, and I had to diversify some of my holdings. I now own two houses, free and clear, with one of them generating regular income. And my portfolio is still less diversified than I‚Äôd like. (Caveat: I have been mostly holding AAPL for nearly 30 years.)"
2025-10-15,"If I needed it next year I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd keep it all in aapl. Maybe half? Half in something more diversified. With all the tariff nonsense that happens at the drop of a tweet, I‚Äôd be a bit risk averse. QQQI is paying 14% div and growing too. I‚Äôm long AAPL, but wary about the Orange Clown"
2025-10-15,I sell covered calls when it gets high
2025-10-15,"It‚Äôs like 25% of my portfolio, conventionally it would make sense to sell but I probably won‚Äôt, I‚Äôll likely draw the % down to about 13% slowly over the next 10 years"
2025-10-16,"How much do you have, how much would you be selling? I might look at using secured stock credit rather than liquidating, unless you're firmly committed to going all cash? 

That all said, for capital gains purposes I'd probably sell ~200 shares at some point this year."
2025-10-16,Buy more
2025-10-16,Did anybody even read his post? He‚Äôs selling regardless to buy a house. I personally like scaling out of stock positions. It‚Äôs more of a regret minimization tactic than anything. Nobody knows the future so getting out at an average over say the next 6 months feels better psychologically.
2025-10-18,Wtf? Don‚Äôt sell lmfao
2025-10-18,You can hold
2025-10-18,Apple is a prolific stock that I buy and do not trade‚Ä¶
2025-10-18,Hi all! What if you only own 100 shares bought at $228/share? Would you sell it now or still hold long term? Considering it‚Äôs only 100 shares shouldn‚Äôt take profit and call it a day? Thanks in advance.
2025-10-21,"Honestly I‚Äôd still hold for a bit. The recent iPhone 17 demand and upgrades from analysts show good momentum. I‚Äôve been trading AAPL futures in Bitget lately and market sentiment still feels bullish.   
  
Depends on your time horizon tho, if you‚Äôre not rushing for that house you might still see some upside."
2025-10-16,Sell aapl their products are for idiots with money
2025-10-16,"üéØüéØ Literally nothing to replace Apple.. there is no world where we all suddenly love the Play Store and surface tablets. I‚Äôm probably in the ecosystem and holding the stock clean into retirement.. 

That‚Äôs both beautiful and terrifying at the same time, one fckd up CEO and we have nowhere to turn, but still, wouldn‚Äôt sell for a house ($500K ranch + 7% interestüò≠) in this market.. I‚Äôd find another way to come up with the funds."
2025-10-16,"I think it's prudent to sell some if you have huge position. That said, probably sold about 25% over the years... I'm not sure if I will again"
2025-10-16,And price could fall after earnings too. Generally ‚Äúwait till it at least hits xxx dollar amount‚Äù is not sound advice.
2025-10-21,Back to say now would be a good time to start selling your position
2025-10-15,I do believe you went to pretend college. My more risk averse friends told me to sell it all when Trump won. Even my NVDA. Could you guys get any stupider?
2025-10-16,I‚Äôve been trying to diversify over the years but I‚Äôve still got a lot with a $10 base price. I‚Äôm attached to them now so hard to let them go
2025-10-16,I asked in Stocks subreddit but they deleted my post üò≠
2025-10-17,"He has a year to offload shares. He could sell now, sure, but chances are, the price will recover and even go higher. Could it tank? Yes, anything could happen, but I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it. 

‚ÄúWait till it hits at least x dollar amount‚Äù is a limit sell order - an extremely common exit strategy."

2025-10-17,"Objectively you‚Äôre not wrong, price will likely go higher and if I had to place a bet one way or another I would put my chips on higher prices. That said if this was a family member of mine I would tell them to scale out over the next 6 months or so. Bc even if prices are higher 1 year from now we don‚Äôt know what the path of that looks like. It could have a 50% drawdown in between that and is OP going to sit tight while he watches his down payment get cut in half? And yes sell limit orders are common place but the funds are ear marked for a down payment so I believe that has to be considered."
2025-10-17,they‚Äôre working on this problem right now. Apple is building a chip factory in Texas. Tsmc is also building factories in the US

The pre-capitulation to a regime's desires in a nominally free country is damaging to the company's brand/image/reputation. I've held shares since Gil Amelio was CEO and have never expressed my opinion on the business practices, because they almost always do the right thing.

2025-10-03,I‚Äôve held for about 15 years now. Was my first big investment out of college. Has been my best performer overall. Sure I‚Äôve had some great shirt term fixes but overall my largest holding. I think it will continue to move up in the LR and don‚Äôt plan to take much out but think there are better (riskier) options to get faster and larger returns. One thing that would make me sell is if they cannot innovate when the inevitable time comes for the cell phone to be phased out and the next generation of tech to phase in.
2025-10-03,Will probably sell in 3 years for a down payment on another house.
2025-10-03,I‚Äôm diversifying about half in a tax efficient manner and holding on to the other half because I believe in the company.
2025-10-03,I sell calls against my position. I assume one day I‚Äôll time it wrong and will have to sell
2025-10-03,I bought most of my Apple shares in October 2000 and added more in the following years.  It's no exaggeration to say that decision changed my life.  But I'm getting to the age where I need to diversify and I have been selling small lots every year.  I'm only doing this because my AAPL shares keep dwarfing everything else in my portfolio.  I 100% believe in the company and would continue to hold otherwise.
2025-10-03,OP I‚Äôm not sure of the specifics but I‚Äôm pretty sure when you inherit an asset I think you‚Äôre supposed to get it at its current cost basis. I‚Äôm an idiot and I‚Äôm sure someone with more knowledge can/will chime in. But in theory you could sell some shares and not pay much in cap gains tax if you wanted to. Something like that anyway.

2025-10-03,Been holding since 2011. I‚Äôve received half of my original investment in dividends alone at this point (reinvested). I think my cost basis is like $13? I‚Äôm still 15-25 years away from retirement. Currently no plans to sell. However. If the stock went crazy enough for me to push my retirement up to that 15 year for sure from 25 for sure. I‚Äôd definitely sell. I just don‚Äôt see that happening.  If we get the same kind of gains the next ten years that we got the last ten I‚Äôd have enough to pay off my home I just bought. But in ten years I‚Äôll be close to paying it off anyway so what exactly am I going to do with the money. But if some crazy innovation came out (I don‚Äôt see it) and it jumped like that next year then yeah I‚Äôm selling. I will probably hold these shares until I get ready to retire truthfully. No kids or plans to have kids so not going to pass them down to anyone.

Even TSLA has a better run. 

I sold some to buy NVDA at the beginning of this year and I have better performance with that. 

I still hold AAPL, but I don¬¥t mind to sell more if there are more stocks with better returns in the future.

Depending if original owner was pre or post required beginning date you‚Äôll have annual RMDs.  No step up in basis as it‚Äôs an IRA.  You could theoretically journal shares to an after-tax account to keep holding but will owe ordinary income taxes on all distributions from the account.  Again, you have 10 years to fully distribute the account starting year after date of death.

You can also take a distribution the year of death to make it an 11 year period instead of 10."

2025-10-03,Same boat as you - it‚Äôs my biggest winner and holding by far. I did sell a chunk during Covid. I was so overweight and needed to balance - I bought mostly Costco with the funds so I‚Äôm in a good place and have much better ‚Äúbalance‚Äù
2025-10-03,one thing the bitcoin bros got right was to hodl for a long time.
2025-10-03,What delta?  Do you sell calls against all your shares or just a portion?
2025-10-04,"I have been doing the same, but the problem is always what do you sell it for....  other than boring ETFs.  I have just lined up about 25 Ai related stocks and diversify into them, and BTC of course.

As an aside I walked up the main street in my local city yesterday and went in to a couple of cafes.  The percentage of people glued to iPhones is very high.  Good job Tim Apple."
2025-10-03,"Not an idiot! If the inherited shares were in an individual brokerage account, you‚Äôre absolutely right, the cost basis increases to the closing price on the day of descendant‚Äôs death. 

Example, I own 100 shares of Apple that I paid $25 for (the cost basis). I die today and you inherit my 100 shares. Your cost basis immediately goes up to ~$257. 

If you then sell at $260 you only pay capital gains on $3/share ($300) versus $235 (257-25)/share ($2350). This step-up in cost basis rule could change but I doubt that will happen very soon."
2025-10-03,"20 years and an 875+% return, at least on my investment."
2025-10-03,"Long-time AAPL holder (~600% gain) who plans to keep until it doesn‚Äôt make sense. The ecosystem continues to strengthen with increases in watch sales to first-time buyers, ubiquity of AirPods, etc. I look at the company as a mutual fund within itself if that makes sense. 

If you want to further diversify or invest in companies other than Apple, you can buy and sell within the IRA with no tax implications. You don‚Äôt pay tax until you withdraw money from the account, which is then taxed as ordinary income vs the capital gains rate. IF you are lucky enough to have inherited a Roth IRA (versus traditional) you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay tax on any withdrawals/distributions because the account was funded with pre-tax dollars. Good luck to you!"
2025-10-03,"No you won‚Äôt if it‚Äôs in the inherited Ira.  Gains are not taxed within retirement accounts. Distributions are taxed and you have RMDs.  Not saying you shouldn‚Äôt should not hold, but your cost basis in a retirement account is meaningless for tax purposes."
2025-10-03,"My shares have increased in value by 81,000% since I bought them.  None in retirement accounts unfortunately.  I retired 10 years early because of Apple"
2025-10-03,"I do it at 20 Delta. Don't really want to sell the shares that badly, but if it goes up and I have to, oh well."

2025-10-03,"Yup, OP dont worry about gains or basis. Everything coming out of a tax deferred acct like a 401/ira is counted as 100% income. Only have to think about cost basis in a regular brokerage account."
2025-10-03,"I am in almost exactly the same position. 
Bought stock after the IT crash in 2000. Not sure of my procentual gain - but I have also been able to retire early (at age 56) due to this. 

Have now sold off half and will continue to sell (mostly due to an orange moron that is hell bent to devalue the dollar, thus making investments in the US very questionable)."
2025-10-03,Delta is the amount of money the option value will move for a dollar of stock movement.  So when you sell a call at a .20 delta the price of the call will increase by .20 every time the underlying increases by $1.  In general if you want to hold onto the underlying stock you would want a lower delta because it essentially means you‚Äôre (hopefully) far enough out of the money that your shares won‚Äôt get called away even if the underlying stock increase in value significantly.  The trade-off is the premiums on a low delta option are not going to be as good.
2025-10-03,"I'm 1000% more up on NVDA

Guess who bought Microsoft I did right before they announced AZURE NVDA beat that and you all know ho MSFT Pivoted and surpassed AAPL so did NVDA

AAPL investors are stuck on what happened nor what will happen. I study trends and put my money where my mouth is on great future bets and leaders"
2025-10-03,"One strategy is to use options to slowly reduce some of your Apple holdings. Sell covered calls, pocket the premiums (helps pay tax when due) and sell the shares at a price you decide you‚Äôd be satisfied with. Your Grandma did a great job picking such a stellar company, she‚Äôd likely be honored for you to ‚Äútake the win.‚Äù 

Options trading is for experienced traders to do on your behalf. Most FPs aren‚Äôt versed in this, as they tend to be focused on your portfolio/net worth as a whole, but may have a department within the brokerage/bank they work for. I trade as a job, investing and planning for retirement are completely different activities. I‚Äôd talk to more than 1 FP and respected people you know who may help guide you to the right person/people to do what is truly in your best interests. This is a great opportunity to learn about strategies for your own retirement/wealth building plans. Redditors have taught me a lot, and investopedia.com is a favorite resource.

2025-10-04,"This is an analyst trying to grab some clicks / airtime with a controversial take. 

Apple designs their price points and model lineup as carefully as they design the products.

Premise: *The iPhone X was an experiment to test whether their customer base would tolerate a four-digit price tag.* 

Previously, the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus went just a bit over $1,000, *if* you maxed out the storage. The iPhone X was super-niche, with a bunch of features and design in order to differentiate it ‚Äî and a base price over $1,000. (You might remember it was the first iPhone without a home button.) The chorus of outraged headlines ""One Thousand Dollar iPhone!"" didn't happen, the phone sold better than expected... *success*.

That led to the current base/pro/max variations and differentiated price points that start much higher, and going well into four-digits. Apple did the same thing with iPods back in the day. The 'mini' experiment has been replaced with older models, in keeping with premium brand marketing strategy of best/newest at the top of the line.

With the 17 lineup, Apple is making iPhone models like iPad. ‚Ä¢¬†Base, for most people  ‚Ä¢ Air, with premium but not Pro features  ‚Ä¢ Pro, with best-in-class performance."

Given apple's current stock price and P/E value, lets assume that they release a new folding iPhone next year which is very popular, so lets assume it drives well above average upgrade and new device purchases, and lets also assume they release smart glasses in the following year which prove to be very popular, lets say about 1/2 as popular as the iPhone. Let's give the folding iPhone a 1600 price tag and the glasses a 1500 price tag.

Let's buy a shit company because there's a remote chance of that happening. And do you really think TSMC isn't aware of this and mitigating these issues?  think hard about that.

2025-09-24,Wrong. AAPL has lagged behind all the rest of big tech the last 9 months and is catching up with big time price target upgrades and the strongest iPhone launch/demand in a number of years.
2025-09-27,"It‚Äôs not froth so much as apple is viewed as a safety play. It tends to rally alongside gold, weirdly enough."
2025-09-25,"The data on launch is super early and has no long term correlation with demand on the whole season. So its not enough if pre orders and early demand is high. Its surprising apple is positive ytd. With tarrifs + ai shift + no device growth drivers yet, its hard to see why investors are buying first and asking questions later."
2025-09-26,"You obviously think AAPL is just an iPhone company. Go back and look at their earnings release. It was fantastic with services continuing double digit growth and insane margins. 

If you don‚Äôt like the company that‚Äôs totally fine but at least try to sound like you understand the business, the cycles, and the products/services."
2025-09-26,"Apple is an iPhone company. The services run on top of the iPhone. If iPhone market share drops 10%, service revenue drops significantly. Everything is tied to the iPhone. It most likely always will be. Cancelling the car project was the nail in the coffin for a growth in consumer wallet for ‚Äúdevices‚Äù"
2025-09-26,"Your car answer is exactly how I know you don't understand what you're trying to talk about. Cars have terrible margins and would expose Apple to the possible negativity surrounding someone dying in an Apple Car. Not to mention there's plenty of tech that came out of that project. Did they spend a bunch of money on it? Sure. Was it going to be the next tent leg? No chance. Look at the car industry in general. It's not a high margin, super profitable sector and that's where AAPL lives. With over 2bn installed AAPL devices in use today which services can be sold on all of them, a drop in market share on the iPhone doesn't impact much of anything because they sell services across the iPads, Mac's, etc as well."

2025-09-23,"Massively overpriced imo. The stock has an earnings yield of 2.67%, and I don't see the company as an innovator like it used to be to grow earnings at a fast rate. As evidenced by earnings and revenue growth being non-existent in recent years.

The brand value inflatiles the price of its products which I don't think is sustainable, and pushes consumers (like myself) towards cheaper competitors with very similar functionality.

It's impossible to say what the price will do in the short term (which is why I wouldn't short it), but I expect mediocre results over the next 5 years."
2025-09-23,Genuine question. How is Apple‚Äôs valuation interesting at a 38 P/E when Google trades at 27 P/E? Google is arguably the only company with a clear path to monetizing AI at scale. Google‚Äôs net income growth was almost double Apple‚Äôs last quarter.
2025-09-22,"For sure, then again we can never predict perfectly how the stock may behave. It may even slightly go above 300 or even more."
2025-09-23,Not likely. Would need to be close to $500/share.
2025-09-23,"Maybe, according to Apple, the stock price target has been raised from 270 USD to 310. This is definitely a message from Apple that their sales are performing abnormally better than before. I'm still putting as much money as I can into Apple."
2025-09-27,"Anything above $300 before mid-January and I'm good, recouped all losses from this year and then some."
2025-09-23,"Keyword: last quarter, u have to compare year by year because apple only releases their product once a year. Comparing last quarter is totally ignoring this ip17 cycle(could be good/bad we don‚Äôt know yet)

Also, apple is apple and Google is Google they are not the same thing, comparing them is not a good analogy, maybe do Microsoft vs Google? and u can also own both btw 

Me personally I find both are awesome"
2025-09-23,Agreed Apple is a crazy buy at this price.
2025-09-22,"I mean that‚Äôs my job :) 
It‚Äôs a buying opportunity until $280"
2025-10-15,"crazy good or crazy bad?

thanks"
2025-09-23,Amazing! $AAPL hit **$256** \- prediction fulfilled!
2025-09-22,What about the added cost of R&D and the addition of a vapor chamber and larger battery? Not to mention the updated front camera sensors and component prices are likely increased.
2025-09-24,why?  is that because rnd is considered sunk?
2025-09-25,Because it‚Äôs not considered cost of sales. Revenue - cost of sales = gross margin. R&d hits later on.
2025-09-22,It's been going up for 40 years. Apple has made millionaires out of ordinary people. There is just 1 small trick: hold long enough and never ever sell when it goes down.
2025-09-22,"If the sales trend for iPhone 17 series continues, I see new ATH‚Äôs in the near future. Maybe $270-280+"
2025-09-22,All time highs coming this week ‚Ä¶. Maybe $270
2025-09-22,Doesn‚Äôt matter I am continually buying this soon 4T company. Take us up AAPL
2025-09-22,"I think the future is looking good,  but I can't tell you where exactly it's going.  

I can tell you that 180 was a joke,  I waited until 200, but hey better than nothing."
2025-09-22,Foldable next year. Hold for now.
2025-09-22,"So glad I kept AAPL and will continue to hold/add to it. The FUD was up there when it seemingly was stuck at or below $210 while the s&p and nasdaq seemed to be climbing. Lately, it's been the lone beat perfromer by far for me."
2025-09-22,"Every time I sell a call on my shares, the stock rockets. I just sold a call last week, so, congrats everybody else."
2025-09-25,"Do y‚Äôall be holding no matter what, or do you sell when it goes up then buy back in when it goes down?"
2025-09-26,What kind of question is this? Not a soul can answer this. A stock can keep going up forever and it can die. Literally no one knows and it isn't always rational. If you believe in the company just invest and hold or don't. Asking people online cannot provide any assurance you're looking for
2025-09-23,Looks like the profit seekers are there already.. backed off the Day highs...
2025-09-22,I retired 10 years early.  100% thanks to Apple.
2025-09-22,"Years ago AT&T ‚Äúscrewed‚Äù me out of my defined benefit pension by paying out a lump sum. I put 1/2 of it into Apple and am realizing that even if I lived to be 130, my Apple investment is far more valuable than that pension ever would have been. Whew. Go long. Hold."
2025-09-22,Reports‚Äô that Apple is ramping up even more production of the iPhone 17 series all around. Hope facts and trends continue
2025-09-22,Hopefully in a specific order. üòÅ down so more people will jump in then up so we can all profit then sideways so I can write covered calls against long stock‚Ä¶ üòâ
2025-09-23,Yes indeed. there was a dip midday but the stock price rebounded nicely towards the days high
2025-09-22,"Congrats!  What‚Äôs your cost basis?  I‚Äôm in at $.33 so it‚Äôs a little over 80,000%.  Besides my wife and kids it‚Äôs easily the best decision I ever made and gave me lots of extra years to enjoy my time with them instead of working."
2025-09-23,Even before today it was up $2 on the year.
2025-09-23,Believe it or not it's negative ¬£394 each ($500 at today's exchange). I've bought & sold over the last 13 years and I've been playing with house money for >5 years
2025-09-20,So bullish.... I knew it when I held the iPhone air for the first time
2025-09-20,Reddit has called Apple dead so many times it‚Äôs comical

2025-09-20,Yup.  It's a beautiful thing.  People will buy it fo sho.
2025-09-20,I am currently 14 pro and My plan was to upgrade pro max.. i held the 17 air today and it got me thinking maybe i should go with air plus the battery pack. I saw youtube testing the airs battery life and it was not bad for how i use my phone.
2025-09-20,Does the battery pack need  a connector to the phone?
2025-09-20,"I had schedule pickup on Sep 19 at 10:15-10:30 pm, I went there and the line was crazy long, then I left. So, I tried to contact with the store through the phone, but it says the store is closed, but google maps says it‚Äôs opened 24hrs."
2025-09-21,"I get what you're saying,  but the odds of losing on options is so ridic high, I don't feel that it's worth it.  I'm in my 40's and to lose it all right now would not be fun .

2025-09-16,"The next earnings call will be interesting. There, we will have a clear picture about their sales and their sales prospect. 

Nevertheless, I see other companies surpassing AAPL very soon in terms of the market cap.

Alphabet surpassing AAPL soon. As soon as we have big news that Gemini will be integrated and power Siri, Alphabet will pop and surpass AAPL."
2025-09-17," you keep saying ""rotten apple""  and we get fantastic financials last quarter,   really strong pre-orders, fantastic service growth and the stock has popped ~13 percent in a month or two..     this is why people shouldn't take advice from the dad accountant types here on reddit."
2025-09-14,The stock always goes goofy in either direction around releases and it seems like this is a fairly successful one. Will be interesting to ride out and see how long it lasts.
2025-09-15,Yes! I want to buy iPhone 17!
2025-09-16,a mighty head and shoulders forming as well...buy at 180
2025-09-15,I‚Äôm a capricorn.  Should I buy now or wait for Mercury to be in regardgrade?
2025-09-14,"At least in what I‚Äôve seen reception across reddit seems to be generally positive. Additionally, ~~they sold out of one model, I believe the PM,~~ [exceeded last years numbers] in one minute on preorder in one of their SEA markets [China]. Compared to a full day to sell out last year. 

If this generation is popular in Asia that‚Äôs big for business. Huawei and Xiaomi [Oppo too. Literally any of the Chinese manufacturers] have been eating their lunch money in terms of innovation and pushing the envelope imo. They need something to give their existing customers there a reason to lock in.

Post add: I also want to note that reception after hitting actual hands is also big for potential momentum. It very well could end up in the typical post Christmas season new years sell off, or momentum could keep building depending on what‚Äôs in store and reactions for the early 2026 releases. If the price spikes a ton I would expect a short term selloff in Jan as people want to reap profits, and news about 2026 releases gets stale."
2025-09-14,You can literally buy the PM online and have it shipped on release day
2025-09-15,Tim Apple knows this.  Observe how at the start of the last product launch event Tim Apple goes on and on about how 'good design' is at the core of Apple's ethos - this (despite being true generally for all Apple products) was just a lead-in for the iPhone Air reveal.
2025-09-17,"Given the reception of the lineup I would say up. Only reason I sold my position was because I have other prospects that I think will be more profitable short term, and I was up a good amount. 

APPL is one of the easiest tickers to scalp options on."
2025-09-14,"*Specific market in SEA.* specifically CHINA. 

Ok my bad. The number of pre orders exceeded last years in one minute, they didn‚Äôt sell out. But people did report having issues with the ordering platform within 15 or 20 minutes."
2025-09-14,[last years first-day presales exceeded in one minute in China](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-pre-orders-apples-iphone-093000782.html)
2025-09-16,Apple has gotten really good and getting inventory and logistics right. Every year the phones are available for much longer than the last and every year they keep beating previous year.
2025-09-16,"TA is just one tool to use in trading. It‚Äôs more nuanced then it‚Äôs nonsense or not nonsense. I guess to be fair TA alone is nonsense, it doesn‚Äôt work 100% and is always incomplete data. But it‚Äôs a tool in a traders toolbox that he uses alongside other tools to make money. Any good trader should be agnostic so kudos to you on that."
2025-09-17,"Uhh if it dips to 220 or 230 that feels like a good buy, but do your own dd ofc."
2025-09-17,"Ohhh. I‚Äôm gambling on RZLV for EoW, otherwise I think BULL has long potential and has been coiling at a crucial level. Easy scalps for me have been BBW and ORLY so working out plays on them too."
2025-09-12,"Iphone 17 Air looks useless, battery is probably not as good as they say that is for sure it‚Äôs too thin."
2025-09-12,That‚Äôs bad
2025-09-12,"Also factor in the ridiculous top heavy THICK plateau and superhigh pricing, resale value plummets"
2025-09-10,"I‚Äôm a long term holder of AAPL and it‚Äôs almost always ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù at these events.  There‚Äôs almost nothing Apple could‚Äôve announced that would‚Äôve changed that dynamic.  In other words, I wouldn‚Äôt sweat the short term dumb money reaction.  Long term Apple is an absolute juggernaut, so ignore the noise and stick to your plan."
2025-09-10,It does this after every release.. Price goes down 1-4% the few days to a week after the event. Then to new highs after 1-6 weeks
2025-09-10,"Holder for 36 years here.  This was just a normal Apple Event. Nothing to support a multiple increase but just enough to support the current high multiple and ensure steady, not spectacular, growth into the future as has always been the case.  The next big move up won‚Äôt come until (if) their next Big Thing. For now, it‚Äôs more of the same which isn‚Äôt a bad thing but already build into the price"
2025-09-10,"There was a killer app shown and no one is making a big deal out of it.  That app was real time translations. Apple will retain business customers because of that. 

Until AI is done on Apple‚Äôs servers and not locally on the Apple silicon, it‚Äôs gonna suck.  Siri has gotten worse with the introduction of ‚Äú**A**pple **I**ntelligence.‚Äù  I use to be able to ask for my music play lists in the car.  Now it gives me search results if I want ‚Äúto continue on my iPhone‚Äù

When Tim Apple retires, Apple will have the opportunity to change its privacy practices and make them pro Apple rather than pro consumer. Does anyone want that?  I‚Äôll bet the big stockholders will.  They are going to want to cash in on all the consumer data by selling it to other companies."
2025-09-10,"This is typical ""sell the news"" action which happens at many Apple events."
2025-09-10,"I wouldn't expect the stock to go up unless Apple announced something big and unexpected. Pretty much everything they was either expected or heavily rumored, so it was just a sell the news event."
2025-09-10,Horrible past week after things were finally starting to look good
2025-09-10,"Not sweating the drop in stock price which is typical after their annual iPhone event. Apple's momentum will continue to gain steam. It's easy to get discouraged with all the haters in the tech media who nitpick the hell out of every product release. They don't represent the average buyer who is far less discriminating and loves Apple products. Keep your eyes on things that are actually important like SALES. Not the so-called must-have features that the tech media elite say Apple will be doomed without. Few people will switch to the Pixel even with its vaunted AI features. 

The pricing strategy this time is very clever particularly with the iPhone 17 priced at $799 and clearly targeted at budget-conscious Chinese consumers. It's packed with value and qualifies for the smartphone subsidy while the iPhone Air and 17 Pro will appeal to deep-pocketed customers and provide choice of form vs. function.

The last quarter blew out expectations even with a so-called ""boring"" iPhone 16 generation. These new phones will sell that much better. Just wait and see."
2025-09-11,"This is normal after product events for Apple.  Hopefully it drops a bit more in the coming weeks, then we can buy more, then when they eventually make an AI announcement the stock will go KA CHING.  Unless of course the orange idiot decides to invade Mexico or some other lie-based vote-getting crazed course of action, which is highly likely."
2025-09-11,"Stocks tend to go up before big events and down after. The hype drops after it happens. Doesn‚Äôt mean it was bad, just excitement simmered, it wasn‚Äôt like truly performance jump"
2025-09-11,Priced in. Always
2025-09-12,"This kind of reaction is pretty typical. Markets usually price in expectations before the event, then cool off after."
2025-09-15,"How many people in your life do you know who are going to run out and upgrade  to the Air outside of replacing old/broken phones?   There‚Äôs nothing they have that is going to start a super cycle and nothing they announced to make an investor feel like that‚Äôs coming in the near future.  A sleeker style, longer battery. etc are nice features but no one really cares.  There‚Äôs nothing here that truly moves the needle for Apple or investors."
2025-09-10,I do expect a downtrend to 220 levels until the next earnings call.
2025-09-11,"AAPL is a joke. 

if you invested in SPY 12 months ago you would have collected a return of \~19%, meanwhile return from AAPL for the same period time is \~3.43%.......might as well just put it in CD for risk free return ü§≠"
2025-09-10,Apple needs to come down to 190s so we can load up for next year longterm.
2025-09-10,"Almost thought you were serious until I kept reading on‚Ä¶ whew great comedy post.

AAPL $150 price target confirmed after this release."
2025-09-10,"Surprised ?

AAPL is same old crap and the market sees it. Their keynote ad yesterday was an unwatchable cringe fest. You had a sickly looking Tym and parachute pants ladies reading scripts. The truth you are stuck with ever more expensive same stuff, no innovation nor joy.  The crap Orange is terrible and only there to mark you at bad at spending money in a world that you may very well be laid off tomorrow.   Apple only stays afloat due to their Duopoly and Monopolist App store shake down .

Wake up there is no joy anymore and AAPL is just clown stomping you every single year , same old story and your family hates that you are an Apple and Tesla raging  fanboy,"
2025-09-10,"Simply this! I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd be here if the stock were like that, like Tesla, trading on vibes! Billionaire bros propping it up until the CEO can get his package.. 

With that being said, I think a foldable iPhone is so cheesy and gimmicky that it WOULD actually tank the stock ..  Apple is known for simplicity and elegance, not sure they could even make a flip iPhone look goodüò≠"
2025-09-10,Hope you sell calls going into these events
2025-09-10,"> I wouldn‚Äôt sweat the short term dumb money reaction.

2025-09-10,I probably will buy more tomorrow
2025-09-15,"An iPhone is a fashion accessory and a status symbol in the first place. If it was not the case, people would just buy Androids.

It‚Äôs the cheapest way to show that you are not poor without overspending. Everything else is way more expensive"
2025-09-15,"Over 70% of people DO buy Android. To create a super cycle you need to convince some of those people not to.  The new Apple phone is fine.  I‚Äôm sure if you‚Äôre an Apple user and your phone dies, youll look to get one of these.  If you are using a phone that is a few gens old and still working fine, what Apple showed here isn‚Äôt enough to make you run out and buy one.  Apple stock is priced like a high growth tech company.  They will need to do more than a slimmer build and a slightly better camera or whatever to keep growing."

2025-09-06,Eh. It‚Äôs going to stay relatively flat over the next couple of years. They have nothing exciting anymore and their main sources of revenue have been gutted
2025-09-06,Investing in apple is so easy. At a two week or one month low? Probably a great time to buy.
2025-09-06,Inverse Reddit on everything for me. Ultimate moment was when there were thousands of comments on Reddit saying Reddit was a failing business model and not to buy it ü§£ü§£ bought and up about 300%

2025-09-06,Same bro. Been holding since 2011. üòÖüòÖüòÖ It‚Äôs so hard to sell any of it at this point.
2025-09-06,"""Too late"" is always a challenging question. I've been happy with the Apple I've held for obvious reasons, but whenever I buy more I try to 50/50 what I'm holding on a permanent basis versus what I'm willing to sell on shorter terms to find other investments.

One thing I do do is figure out exactly what I'd want to sell at, and do covered calls for that. Either it's premium upside or I get the money I'm looking to pull out out."
2025-09-06,"I bought after the IT crash in 2000. 

Have started to offload. Both because the growth is slowing - and due to the dollar becoming weaker compared to my Swedish crona.

I was surprised by the reddit surge though it is such a shitty echo chamber but you did well."
2025-09-06,I‚Äôve held for 14 and made a pretty good return. If it hits $300 I‚Äôm planning on pulling my initial investment so it‚Äôs all house money.
2025-09-07,Some of us have LEAP options. We have to sell
2025-09-07,"We have been told that 2026 will be the year when Apple revamps its Siri AI and takes it to another level. Will the audio AI be really mature in one year? Can we expect Apple to make Siri much better in 2026? This is what is keeping me from not selling any shares. 

But with the recent news that they are internally conflicted about building AI internally versus relying on 3rd party or acquisitions makes me doubt that one year is enough for them. Given. that we know, Apple would rather not release new products which are not reaching their ceiling of quality."
2025-09-06,"They are taking a smarter approach, but that doesn't change the fact that it's barely growing with like a 35-40 multiple.

Apple is crazy overvalued."
2025-09-06,Yeah and TSLA is overvalued too but people keep pumping it to high heaven. I think AAPL isn‚Äôt correcting down in a long term way any time soon.
2025-09-06,"Realistically you can say the same about all of the Mag 7. Tesla is insanely overvalued, Nvidia is if you consider that their sales are dominated by a handful of buyers, etc. 

But as long as money keeps pouring into exchange funds, money keeps pouring into the ones who dominate them. Makes it *very* hard for them to crack."
2025-09-06,"I‚Äôm long apple but don‚Äôt be coping they are taking a smarter approach, they are just behind"
2025-09-06,"Well, those others are growing way more. Not saying they are all cheap either, but they are growing much faster than Apple. Why pay 35x Apple when you can get more growth at 25x at Google (or whatever). These aren't precise values.

Apple has some of its highest PE levels with some of its lowest growth levels, historically."
2025-09-06,"My honest opinion is that Apple doesn't need the same sort of AI products like Google, MSFT, Meta, etc because they don't offer ""services"" that need it.

Apple is a consumer hardware company that makes the majority of their money from hardware sales and app store revenue (plus Google search deals).

Aside from improving Siri, why do they need generative AI enterprise services etc? They aren't a B2B or enterprise company. The vast majority of AI revenue is coming from businesses, not consumers.

Also, look how quickly AI and open source is progressing. It's very likely that Apple's Siri AI/on-device AI needs will be child's play in the near future. Google, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Anthropic, xAI... no one is ever in the lead for more than a few months. They are all chasing the exact same thing, never being a leader for long because everyone is doing the same thing, using the same public/open source research.  
  
Or look at Nvidia DLSS. Great tech, but now you have versions by AMD, Intel, etc. Soon everyone will have it because it will be widely understood.

OpenAI's GPT3,5 technology is now next to worthless most likely. In a year or two, 4.0 will be worthless, yet 4.0 would probably be sufficient for Apple's on-device needs like basic AI commands etc.

They are behind, but they will be able to buy a ""good-enough"" product for dirt cheap going forward because their needs will never be ""cutting-edge"" enterprise level needs."

2025-09-04,"AAPL seems to just go up?  There are early vertical moves the last 18 months but a steady up and to the right.

2025-09-05,"I've been long AAPL since 2012 and was very overweight, so I sold 800 yesterday.

2025-09-05,"Yeah it makes up about 20% of my holdings that was why I took some profit at the New Year, that being said I would like to see it at $260 again in 2026 before I take some more profits and rebalance."
2025-09-04,So relieved I've kept my shares despite being tempted to liquidate for other stocks when it was hovering around $200-210. The past month it's been my best performer compared to the rest of the sector. Hopefully it will continue a steady path back towards $260 and beyond
2025-09-03,"goog up 40 percent on the month.  It wasn't on my radar,  so congrats to those holding it

2025-08-29,That's where I sit.  My son is still on his 8 and he no longer gets updates.  Ill probably give him my 14 and move up.  Just unsure yet. My wife had a 14 which she gave to my daughter a year ago and she moved to the 16.  Years back we were a new every 2 family but have since cooled on that stuff.  I sat on my 7plus for the 14!  That was the longest I ever waited. Ha!
2025-08-28,"I found the following (unverified and ballpark) numbers from asking ChatGPT.

\- Google processes more than¬†**5 trillion search queries annually,** generating \~$198.1 billion search revenue.

**-** Although Apple's total share of web usage globally hovers around¬†**28‚Äì30%**, its users drive over¬†**half**¬†of Google‚Äôs search business‚Äîand likely¬†**three-quarters**¬†of Google‚Äôs mobile search revenue.¬†

\- OpenAI's traffic is about 7.44 billion per year, generating about $260 million traffic value.

So Apple takes $20b from the 2.5 trillion search queries, which generates \~$100b for Google, it sends to Google annually. If Apple sends that traffic to OpenAI, it should increase OpenAI's traffic by \~336 times, which extrapolate to $87 billion revenue annually, from which Apple can take a 20% cut ($17b) per year. And since OpenAI is not a monopoly, that is on sound legal ground as well.

From that logic, Google is the party that should be worried, not Apple."
2025-08-28,"Not just revenue. It‚Äôs a direct profit hit.

It will hit Google a bit as well. Even if 5% people choose something else as their default browser, they lose billions."
2025-08-28,"Google made this deal to avoid paying TAC. If the deal is struct down they will revert to paying Apple TAC, which could end up being more than the $26 billion they were paying. Do you really think Google was paying such a large sum for nothing?"
2025-08-28,"Maybe it would be better for Apple in the long run.   
If their deal with Google ends, they have the tech (already indexed the web years ago), to create their own search engine (this was rumored before). Which would be very bullish.  
I see this similar to their breakup with Intel. It was the best decision they made when they finally decided to move on."
2025-08-30,Great news
2025-09-01,"I actually think Google will be a winner if this agreement gets struck down. IMO the amount they‚Äôre paying Apple for this is asinine. The overwhelming number of iOS users are going to choose Google for search without Google having to pay a dime in ad sharing or preferred placement. The AI threat would be a bigger issue - but that would be the case regardless. 

As for Apple - yeah this blows for them. All that high margin cash gone."
2025-08-28,AAPL just raised the price on one of their services to offset the loss in revenue from GOOGL. Apple has problems and they know it. They used to hide what was going to be announced to get a splash affect and it was free advertising from the media. Now they are ‚Äúleaking‚Äù full high resolution pictures and videos of products that quite frankly are not enough to justify their PE ratio. They‚Äôve been on the downward since 2020 and Warren sees it too. I have AAPL at a very low cost basis and am going to sell out of all except a hundred shares by the end of next year. The growth is elsewhere IMO.
2025-08-28,"As a google investor, Apple is stealing from Google. What a deal for Apple. Google doesn‚Äôt need to buy being default search. In Europe, they can‚Äôt buy default status and still own 90% of search. I think Apple made a hell of a deal and google does get default status but I argue they don‚Äôt need it because they are already the best. 

As for Chatgpt extras you added, I‚Äôm very bullish in the other way. GPT has had its Yahoo moment but will become a commoditized api. This is a separate discussion altogether though so don‚Äôt want to derail. Lastly, if the ruling does not allow purchase of default status, Apple won‚Äôt be able to sell to anyone anyways."
2025-08-29,Are you high? Google was/is literally paying Apple TAC. Are you saying because this is a ‚Äúrevenue sharing‚Äù agreement for ad revenue you consider it something else? There is no way this gets replaced with a simple direct TAC payment. No payments here are coming back. It‚Äôs more likely payments start to flow in reverse! Apple starts paying Google for training a custom Gemini model for Apple.
2025-09-01,In the short term revenue its bullish. I would love for the stock price to drop only for google to bring in aditional 25b profit next year.
2025-08-28,The 35 pe is my concern. I haven‚Äôt bought any in maybe 2-3 years. I have massive gains myself and don‚Äôt want to oay capital tax. So you think this will stabilize somewhat over next two years or this is apple acting their age and becoming no longer a growth stock. That 35 pe worried me.
2025-08-30,Apple isn‚Äôt stealing from Google. Google gets great value from these payments. The only company that could stand a chance to compete with Google on search who has their own distribution (owning the iphone software stack) and has shown they are willing to compete (See Apple Maps) is Apple. The payments are so Apple doesn‚Äôt feel the need to build Apple Search to acquire their own advertising revenue. They just take a bunch from Google. This is exactly why these payments are going to end. They are purely about avoiding competition to maintain monopoly status and monopoly profits.
2025-08-28,Long AAPL. 2-3 years AI will become more useful on phones and Apple might just pull it off imo.

2025-08-30,"It‚Äôs more like if the payments stop then Apple now has a reason to enter the web search business. Apple and Google competing on search is mutually destructive. Its better if Google can maintain the monopoly, take maximum profit, and kick some back to Apple for not competing. These payments will end. Its clearly anti competitive"
2025-08-30,"Given search is Google's core business, it makes little sense for Apple to compete head-on there. And it was not a service that can be integrated into Apple's ecosystem. But with the arrival of ChatGPT and personal assistant in general, the situation has changed fundamentally. Going forward personal assistant is going to be the underpinning function of almost every application. So Apple has strong reasons to build it internally despite falling short in the first attempt at Apple Intelligence. Regardless what the result of the lawsuit will be, a sea change is coming. AI is so much more than search."

2025-08-31,"Tell that to spotify for Apple music. Netflix for Apple TV+. it doesn't need to become as big as the head on player, it just needs to give Apple users a reason to not buy something else. That money transfer exists because Google doesn't want to see ""Apple Search"" as the main way people keyword search in the URL bar in Safari on iPhones. It's that simple. The second order effect is loss of user data of course. But it's more just about not capturing the market."
2025-08-29,"Exhibit A: Bud Light
Exhibit B: Cracker Barrel

2025-09-01,"Many companies can't compete with Apple in business, so they resort to legal fight. Google has had its shots with Android and Chrome, but it still needs to bribe a little to maintain its dominance in search. It's not like they haven't tried. The Epic Games lawsuit is really Tencent's attempt to pry open Apple's payment system. They have a 40% stake in Epic Games. Tencent has a payment processing system with \~$1.7 trillion USD transactions annually, mostly in China. Think about how much they will rack in if Epic wins, not to mention the user data they will get their hands on. Spotify, Netflix, Google Maps are better than Apple counterparts, but Apple's doing just fine with these services."

Trump‚Äôs desire to end globalization and free trade will certainly dampen this trend but it‚Äôs how things have gone for over 30 years through many economic environments. Covid lockdowns, excessive stimulus, and free monetary policy disrupted the trend. 

We were returning right back to 2-3% inflation before tariffs began to hit the economy. We currently sit at 2.7% inflation as of July.

2025-08-18,"I had a huge order around 10? days ago for $200. It hit $201.50 or so, then reversed when Tim Cook visited the Oval Office. I took some at $230, but want more if it dips."
2025-08-12,Great news! That‚Äôs reciprocal gifts.
2025-08-11,Likely that AMD and NVDA increase prices for GPUs they sell into China to cover this new tax
2025-08-11,Not a good day so far
2025-08-12,"It‚Äôs more bad than good. It‚Äôs a slippery slope to any amount- he even said that during his announcement this morning that there could be an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù amount. So they want control of universities, companies and CEO and other hire and fires and that sounds ok to you? Factor in the pay to play money - sounds like corruption, extortion and illegal to me."
2025-08-11,This is more common than you think. I've seen it in the solar industry in local jurisdictions as well. It's called the price of doing business

2025-08-11,it‚Äôs 15% of revenue. increasing prices for china increases revenue and will increase how much they have to pay. they‚Äôll probably increase prices for sales outside of china to cover eventually.
2025-08-11,You got it. They use to be called taxes‚Ä¶ Trump would never call them that. Guess that is why Congress has not passed a bill that would tax corporations more on foreign revenue‚Ä¶..
2025-08-11,"It's 15% on the revenue, not on the profit, so the margin has to be higher to compensate. Might get price increases, or just no shipments altogether in some cases."
2025-08-11,"For better or worse, Trump is pulling levers no President before him ever considered pulling. It‚Äôs insanely anticapitalist and is founded on completely idiotic economic theory, but fucking hell is it crazy to watch corpos get absolutely manhandled."

2025-08-09,The eventual release of the folding phone/ipad or whatever it is should drum up excitement. And Apple is quietly buying up smaller AI companies and being very methodical (as they often are) about how best to incorporate AI into their products. If they succeed with this then that‚Äôs also a catalyst
2025-08-09,"600 billion in spending and I‚Äôm sure trump is going to keep an eye on how fast this money comes in. I think a lot of companies are telling trump what he wants to hear , but drag their feet as long as possible. Could backfire. Also if tariffs affect the pocketbooks of Americans they won‚Äôt be rushing to upgrade their phone in this cycle. I have an iPhone 13 Pro which seems the same as current model. I going to be a bit bearish on the stock for now."
2025-08-10,Been loading up on GFS calls since they're basically Apple's fab partner now. Tiger options has been solid for tracking this whole sector rotation - makes it easy to see which chip stocks are moving together vs getting left behind. Crazy how fast the market repriced everything based on who has US manufacturing vs who doesn't.
2025-08-09,"The 600 billion is gonna affect the stock in a short term _news media will hang partially negative  over the next quarter or so how is it affect bottom line while they‚Äôre doing these changes;  stock pull  back about 10% but into next year in the year after count on 300 next year (with a course of pull back About 20% or so,) a year after year growth on the stock price return from these level should be about average of 20% a year for the next five years. That‚Äôs the bottom line and that‚Äôs what people need to know."
2025-08-09,It‚Äôs all smoke and mirrors. Look at aapl capex in the last few years. The real question is when will they release a new product that will generate step level increase in revenue. This stock is surviving on buybacks.

2025-08-09,It‚Äôs not that this comment should not be argued or made‚Ä¶i hear you‚Ä¶HOWEVER‚Ä¶AAPL is NOT primarily a software firm like MSFT‚Ä¶that also means while they can not put themselves out on the bleeding edge of growth‚Ä¶they can instead stand firmly inside the enormous growing edge and collect consumer‚Äôs money‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a very different approach admittedly‚Ä¶and not one that is intuitively reached because we don‚Äôt face the obligations and responsibilities associated with managing a firm of that size so the considerations needed are also not intuitive‚Ä¶.that seems both logical and reasonable to me‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶im a holder and investor in the equity‚Ä¶.that explains parts of why that is‚Ä¶

2025-08-10,"Yeah. It‚Äôs amazing that this sub is so cultist to not see that it‚Äôs been reiterations of Macs, iPhones and watches for 10 years. 

This is why I sold all my shares at 245. $250k worth.

2025-08-09,317 exactly!! I wish I could show my positions here I‚Äôve been to Holder since 2008. I sold it at the peak in December _not all of it. Some of it I bought back at 203 last week. It‚Äôs gonna run right to 317 by next March -_look at some of my past posts.
2025-08-09,I got 20  Jan 25 250 calls. 300 is the target!

2025-08-09,Time to buy calls?
2025-08-09,I bought a options call for Apple with the strike price of $230.55 do you guys think it‚Äôs gonna hit $234 or $232 next week because the option expires next week on the 15th I know it‚Äôs very risky. That‚Äôs why.
2025-08-09,"I just got back in at $202 this past week thinking, well at least this will be a stable position for a while. Then boom!!"
2025-08-09,$700 in 2026/27. then another split.
2025-08-09, i sold msft at 430 if it makes you feel better.  not selling this tho
2025-08-09,I had a 215 covered call for 8/22 that is now deep ITM. I don't want to lose the shares so I might have to buy it back. This surge has cost me.
2025-08-10,I sold pltr at 17. There will always be another stock to buy.¬†
2025-08-09,"Since 2006, and added more every other year until 2012. Turned on divided reinvestments. Trimmed a little couple of years to get into NVDA to ride the AI wave. Trimmed a little on NVDA recently to put in PLTR recently. The downturn in Apple didn‚Äôt bother me at all. Because it is a quality stock. Apple gets bitched at for lack of innovation. People asking for Tim‚Äôs head, but he pulled a great executive play once again and I am sure he will pull the innovation stunt also. Just hold on for the ride."
2025-08-09,2005 here and wish I‚Äôd bought more. Only sporadically after that and have been re-investing the dividends.
2025-08-10,"That‚Äôs fast growth. The analysis I‚Äôve seen is that the stock is riding the high of the US manufacturing announcement. The announcement of investment in AI will help, but it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess as to how quickly and how much that will float the stock."
2025-08-09,Yea I had  220/225/230 CCs deployed when it was 202 before earnings and this is crushing my position. Probably just letting them get assigned and reposition with CSPs for a while with the cash.
2025-08-09,"just roll it up and out.

e: scenario 1 it keeps going up, you can always roll up+out to capture more unrealized. scenario 2 it stagnates allowing theta to erode the short call. scenario 3 it pulls back and you can buy back the short call much cheaper and lock 50-80%+ gains from it."
2025-08-09,Bro I had a 220 covered call that expired today that would‚Äôve costed 3 CENTS to close on aug 5th but I didn‚Äôt and now that shit is getting assigned with appl at 230 and no signs of stopping the gamma squeeze
2025-08-09,Mines at235 with initial avg at 213. I‚Äôll make 10k profit but wow if it blows past ima be pissed
2025-08-11,Same. Like $10k and for a loss at that
2025-08-09,Exactly right‚Ä¶have owned and added more for decades‚Ä¶the next dividend will add over 5K worth of new shares‚Ä¶
2025-08-09,"I bought too much and in 08 I was told by many people to stop buying _and I would‚Äôve had 17,000 shares today at this price. I have a few thousand shares as a constellation though I had a buy order in at 203 last week. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs 230 already Like my post says this should hit just over 311 next year and then we‚Äôll get a test back to the 240s 250s year /2 after."

2025-08-08,"I‚Äôm still not sold on their AI investment / strategy. They have been, and will continue to be, blown out by the real hyperscalers. 

This jump is from Tim Cook bending the knee to Trump. Giving him a gold plaque and a $100B US investment during a televised ceremony is EXACTLY what Trump wants. Apple will be rewarded for this in the coming years and the market knows it."

2025-08-13,"It‚Äôs up 4% over the last year. How does that compare to the S&P500 & the Nasdaq 100? Chill out brah, literally nothing has changed in the investment thesis or growth trajectory"
2025-08-08,"Perhaps. Or will we all use ‚Äúgeneric terminals‚Äù that get their smarts, wits, data and feeds from a single AI app, which goes out to the meta web world to collect as needed? 

In other words, if ChatGPT or Gemini or Claud app could stream spotify, manage your agenda, check mails, feed you netflix and youtube‚Ä¶. how will an IPhone outcompete a Samsung? Aren‚Äôt all devices at that point just ‚Äòdumb‚Äô terminals ‚Äî fast chip, good modem, nice screen? How will Apple make money from services then?"
2025-08-09,Ezactly this is the sole reason Apple ran up. If it wasn't for that it would be trading flat still. It's a Trump market and if you talks good about a stock or gives them a pass = sky rocket.
2025-08-08,"That bending the knee was trading a gift, for 100% tariff exemption. Trump‚Äôs tariffs were holding AAPL back and it ripped afterwards."
2025-08-08,"I do somewhat agree, Tim Cook has been holding Trumps hands since his last term. That said, I still believe the widely thought of ‚Äúunderperformance‚Äù while still delivering on results + new announcement (yes getting on his knees) does position them well as they‚Äôll find a way (largely in the form of exemptions as we‚Äôve already seen) to avoid increased price/labor due to tariffs"
2025-08-08,"I‚Äôm much more worried about their lack of clear direction in the AI space than I am about tariff concerns in the short term (assuming Trump will be out in 2028). For context, I‚Äôm also a 15+ year shareholder that plans to hold long term so my priorities might not line up with everyone else‚Äôs."

2025-08-09,The margins on manufacturing aren't always that great. The US also isn't exactly starving for well paying jobs that don't involve breathing lead fumes for 14 hours. AI or automated manufacturing also don't lead to mass employment benefits (ask Japan). This whole thing wasn't very well thought through. The American economy boomed in part because manufacturing got offshored and corporate profits swelled. Reshoring causes corp profits to drop. There just isn't any 2 ways about that. Not reshoring causes corp profits to drop because of tariffs. Again the math just works that way. We haven't seen any drops yet because of front loading imports. This stock market is a pure momentum play right now.
2025-08-08,"Not sure of your full thought or idea, but it always comes down to cost.  Any manufacturing the tooling and automation takes years sometimes decades to recoup.  Even using automation or Ai processes the cost would crush any profits for years, it would be cheaper to absorb tariffs short term and wait out the policy changes."
2025-08-08,"Looks like Tim Apple believes him. Redefine manufacturing. We‚Äôre in the Upside Down world, so start thinking outside the box."

2025-08-07,I‚Äôm nearing 100k of apple. I trimmed a bit during covid but spent most of the proceeds on Costco. I‚Äôm way heavy in apple but i have no reason to belive selling is a wise choice. Been holding for 15+ years
2025-08-07,It‚Äôs been a minute. Was hoping for a split once it breached $1k
2025-08-07,that will happen once I sell
2025-08-06,"You‚Äôve been holding since 2006‚Ä¶in those *19 years, how often has it swung?  Should most of your portfolio be on one stock? No. Is Apple still a good stock - yes. There is nothing saying you can‚Äôt sell some and still hold."
2025-08-06,"instead of reinvesting the dividends in AAPL, invest dividend earnings into the ETF of your choice.

Other than that, there‚Äôs probably some lots in your holdings that can be sold with little or no taxes (past dividend reinvestments that aren‚Äôt too profitable, other personal tax situation reasons). Find out how much you can sell and convert to your ETF of  choice."
2025-08-06,im in same boat and aapl is like 1/3 of my assets. the huge cap gains taxes preventing me from selling so far but am uncomfortable with such high % in one stock. i plan to sell up to the 0% tax bracket yearly when i retire
2025-08-06,I would wait until seasonality kicks in. December is usually pretty strong and then you can sell before the end of the year and plan your taxes for April.
2025-08-07,Hold
2025-08-06,"I‚Äôm in the same situation. In my view AAPL is now a blue chip; it‚Äôs not going to double every two or three years, but it is a great company that will hold its value, will be a dividend grower in the coming years, and will grow slowly through new businesses and share buybacks. Basically, it‚Äôs a great company to have a few million dollars in.  You should reinvest the dividends for new growth, and maybe trim a little here and there for reinvestment, especially if you have any shares in an IRA.  But overall I think you should just be happy you made such a good investment, and that you have that at the core of your portfolio."
2025-08-07,"I know exactly where you're coming from and, tbh, was getting spooked as well but I'm quite reassured by the last earnings report. I've felt better since then with continuing to hold. Still, future performance is unpredictable and I can't say with full confidence that holding such a large position over the long term is a surefire way to success. At the end of the day many of us here are over-concentrated in one position and that's increasingly risky as we get older and approach retirement.  


As far as how I've dealt with it: one of the best things you can do, if you give charity regularly, is to donate shares. I've done this yearly with my most heavily appreciated shares to offset capital gains and gain a deduction on my taxes. A good time to sell shares is if you have irregular income, e.g. your own business, and you're in a down year. Or if you're in between jobs and don't expect to have much income. Perfect time to sell off shares to minimize capital gains tax. Lastly another thing that can ease the pain of taxes is if you find another great investment that you feel strongly will outweigh the tax burden with future gains. This is a good way to limit the psychological pain of selling. 

All of that being said, the conventional wisdom is to sell down your position to whatever you feel is reasonable, be happy with your gains over the years, and invest in index funds. I've struggled to do that myself even though it makes logical sense for risk mitigation but the psychological barrier is pretty strong. First world problems, to be sure."
2025-08-06,"Hold! You wouldn‚Äôt be where you are now without holding through a lot worse stuff. For example 100 shares sold in the 2008 shake-up missed out on $500,000. Edit: of gains. Don‚Äôt watch if it makes you nervous, go for a walk."
2025-08-06,"Long term capital gains tax rate is probably 15% or 20% for you, unless you live in California. If you don‚Äôt live in CA, maybe you should sell some shares and pay the tax to ease your worries a bit. 50% of portfolio in a single stock is too much risk, even though AAPL is a pretty solid stock.

If you do sell, minimize gains by selling specific lots with the least gains. Then try not to regret your decision if AAPL goes up to $250 again soon."
2025-08-07,Just hold‚Ä¶ reinvest the dividends to something else an etf‚Ä¶ your dividend  return on cost is like amazing‚Ä¶ congrats do some cover call maybe less than 10% of Apple holding that you don‚Äôt mind losing and use that to buy new shares of something else‚Ä¶
2025-08-07,"Sell it over the next few years, and diversify into an ETF. Theres no way to avoid tax (unless you‚Äôre Apple, ironically!) so just take the hit. You‚Äôve done well and I think this stock has long seen it‚Äôs ATH."
2025-08-08,"Hold it for 1 more year, $300+ by next summer/fall"
2025-08-06,Sell calls while its up.
2025-08-07,Congrats on the killer trade. If your position is in a taxable account you will only pay the really very low capital gains rate. I would take advantage of that and sell some shares and put the money into a fund like SPY or VTI. You‚Äôve made a lot of money but now you have an outsized risk with too much exposure to one stock.
2025-08-07,I inherited thousands of shares of Apple after my mom died recently last year. The majority of her brokerage account is an apple but I am slowly selling off some of it to diversify more. Want to eventually sell about 30% of it.
2025-08-07,"I am in the same boat. My split adjusted share price is less than 25¬¢ (I bought in 2002) - It is more than 50% of my portfolio too, and every financial advisor has told me to diversify (if I had done that I would be millions poorer) - best thing you can do is borrow against it and leave it to your children where it assumes today's basis."
2025-08-07,"Also long term holder, 2007. I feel like Apple figuring out AI isn‚Äôt that well priced in, however I‚Äôm shocked that they‚Äôve gone this long without figuring it out when so many of the other big tech companies quickly adapted. So that part of it has made me lose a lot on confidence, combined with lack of new product innovation. The iPhone or bust seems to be the hill they‚Äôre going to die on. Every time I think I should just sell and get out of it something happens and it pops like it did today, so I don‚Äôt know, they keep on churning."
2025-08-08,"I would sell long term covered calls (more than a year out so no short term capital gains if they expire worthless) against a lot of your position and use those funds to diversify, as well as manicakes said which is making sure dividend auto-reinvest is off. If your shares get called away you'll have done incredibly well; if not at least you used the money to diversify and when they expire you can sell covered calls again. 

  
I'd probably stagger the strike prices (let's say you choose dec 2026 as expiration):

e.g. 30% at $260 strike, 30% at $270, 30% at $280 and maybe keep 10% uncapped."
2025-08-09,Hold . The game just started
2025-08-09,"Well, first of all congratulations! It‚Äôs really a great problem to have. I am in the same boat as you: too many apples in one basket : brokerage, trad IRA and Roth. Now newly retired so my strategy is to trim a bit every year, even if it means triggering a one or step increase in IRMA Medicare annual payments. I will also transfer shares to my two adult daughters yearly.
I stopped reinvesting dividends a few years back and have started depositing the dividends into VTI or VOO. 
I am still long for Apple, however I will also strongly consider setting a target sale price in my Roth so I can diversify a bit more."
2025-08-09,"A zero-cost collar could be the move here if you‚Äôve got a big AAPL position you don‚Äôt want to sell yet.

Sell a covered call a bit above where we are now (\~$229) and use that premium to buy a protective put a bit below. Example:

* Sell a long term $240 call
* Buy a long term $220 put using the money you get from selling the call (gotta tweak the strike prices to see what makes sense or what gets you to zero-cost)

Upside is capped, but you don‚Äôt have to sell and trigger taxes now to lock in your gains, the put insures the gains and allows you to sell in chunks that are more manageable for taxes.  

Mark Cuban did something similar to this in ‚Äô99 after selling [Broadcast.com](http://Broadcast.com) to Yahoo ‚Äî got $1B in Yahoo stock, slapped a collar on it, and walked away with the full value when the dot-com crash nuked Yahoo‚Äôs share price. Without it, he would‚Äôve lost hundreds of millions.

If AAPL tanks, you‚Äôre covered. If it rips past $240, you give up gains above that but if you're just trying to preserve your gains without triggering massive taxes this might be a way to do that using options.."
2025-08-06,"I have been in a similar situation.  I asked myself would I buy all those shares at today's price.  The answer was no f*cking way.  I was also more than happy with the profits achieved.  I made a plan, and started selling incrementally at highs and put the money into dividend paying shares/ dividend ETFs/ Bitcoin.  Yes Apple is likely to go up (maybe slowly) in the future, but I would rather take some gains and rebalance my portfolio than have such a high concentration in one stock.  Even after doing all that I still hold a high % of Apple and am still ok with having a big chunk going forward.  I may not be correct, but for me that was the best route I could think of."
2025-08-06,"Op i can totally relate with you‚Ä¶ i have ton of share in my brokerage around 1500 and another 3600 in my stock plan. Been holding it from 10+ years and been through swings. 

This time the downturn is nothing like we have seen before, they always had some new revenue source at horizon earlier (watch, airpods, services) despite challenges like tariffs in 2017, china issues

This is first time when they are having all headwinds together again and this time they don‚Äôt have any new revenue source or product on horizon as well(foldable phone and glasses are far). 

I am in pickle myself and almost convinced growth story is done but selling now will bring huge tax bill. So i am gonna part ways with it slowly. Ignore the noises"
2025-08-06,"Maybe rebalance and take the opportunity to look for a potential growth stock like AAPL was 10+ years ago

A lot depends on your risk appetite. 

Your decision will need to take account of your plans. What are you investing for and over what timescale."
2025-08-06,"I think most long-time AAPL holders tend to not be bothered by outsider valuations too much, but I'm curious what you think of the internal politics of the company. Cook is due to stand down and a lot of their AI missteps seem to be coming from an internal struggle between execs.

What kind of personnel shake up might be good for the stock short term but would clarify things for you and cause you to dump?"
2025-08-07,"I‚Äôd sell some to diversify if I was you but it depends what you‚Äôre going to buy with the sale.  If you don‚Äôt know how to pick well, May be better to leave it."
2025-08-07,"50% of your portfolio is quite a bit in 1 stock that's not an index. If you wanted to reduce your position you could sell calls against it.. Say you had 5k shares and you wanted to go to 2.5k.. Sell 5 calls till they are assigned, then keep selling till you reduce your position to 2.5k shares then dca into something else.¬†"
2025-08-07,"What would your capital gain tax be if you reduced some? Do you think the stock will decline by more than the taxes you‚Äôd pay? And better yet, do you think you can re-invest the proceeds from the sale in something that will return an amount greater than the taxes paid in short order?"
2025-08-07,"If you don‚Äôt think AAPL is the next AAPL, sell a good chunk and put it into the next two companies with products AND services that are either currently in or will be soon in high demand. I personally have been holding for over 25 years and have trimmed over the years. It wasn‚Äôt until recently I considered selling all of it so I sold covered calls at $215 and will roll them out every 30 days until next tax year when I can decide to keep or let go depending on the narrative at years end given these new announcements. Note, it had a big sell order come in at the end of today so there were definitely profit takers."
2025-08-07,"Sell covered calls with 25% of your shares

Sell 28 day CC
Roll at 14 days
If you did that last 6 months you would have made üöÄüí∞üí∞"
2025-08-07,I say sell and move on lmao
2025-08-07,"Diversify without any Tax consequences a part of your AAPL position, say 10-30%. Look into exchange funds, I just joined two and I am very happy with my move. Good Luck"
2025-08-07,"I held like you thousands of AAPL at a cost basis of a few dollars. As such, every quarter I get reinvested AAPL shares adding to the pool. 
This pool is loan to a prime brokerage through my broker. As I have a margin account, I can negotiate a low margin rate and pretty much pay my expenses while holding onto my AAPL shares. 
Yes, I have seen my AAPL balloon to over 30% (of portfolio) the first time it ran to 260. I have. Since bought more SPY to reduce AAPL to under 20%. 
Still large and like many these days, the other 80% includes the other Mag 7. 

So. I hold."
2025-08-07,"I was in this position, I‚Äôve been selling covered calls of AAPL to make some cash while balancing my portfolio. AAPL is a great stock, but I believe there are better stocks out there poised for more growth/gains."
2025-08-12,"Take a look at exchange funds. They essentially a vehicle for this exact scenario, where you diversify with other highly concentrated investors after a lockup period. There is no taxable event"
2025-08-06,"Warren Buffet still has a lot of apple, but he is diversified. Look for other options sell half"
2025-08-07,"sell. 

never underestimate opportunity cost"
2025-08-07,Sell it. Apple is a broken stock. Every every every pop meets with a fade. People on this sub are crazy. Saying to hold 3-5 years. Okay. Last thing you want to hear is hold another 3-5 years cause you‚Äôve already held 10 years. The stock fucking sucks sell it and get into another stock that actually moves and doesn‚Äôt consolidate for half a year
2025-08-11,"Apple is an amazing company. I would continue holding. I use Apple products of course, but not someone who changes my iPhone every year. Even then, I recently started purchasing their Apple care one subscription, which is a new stream of revenue for Apple. No other company comes even close in terms of the products they offer"
2025-08-06,"This is the way if you can manage it.  
I had hoped to do this when I retired but I‚Äôve got too many other things filling up that bracket.  GRRRRR!!!!!! 
There are worse problems to have I keep telling myself."
2025-08-07,Selling when you have little to no income is the way. Depending on cost basis it will be a yearly ‚Äúsalary‚Äù for many people if they just hold until retirement
2025-08-07,"Why would you ever take a giant gain in December? That‚Äôs a crazy bad idea. Sell a covered call for January if you really want to lock in price, but owing taxes in April 2026 vs April 2027 makes a huge difference"
2025-08-07,How much long term tax in california?
2025-08-07,I really wish I understood covered calls.
2025-08-07,If it hits 300 I will sell all my apple and move it to index funds
2025-08-07,Well timed lolz.  $220 at the time of writing.
2025-08-07,"haha me too, early retirement and those pesky dividends!"
2025-08-07,"I echo this, covered calls for income would be great. If you don't want the shares to sell, choose a higher delta like 0.2‚ñ≤ or less. If you would like to see some shares actually sell, then choose a delta like 0.3‚ñ≤ to 0.4‚ñ≤"
2025-08-07,"Capital gains are taxed as regular income in California, with a progressive tax rate, up to 13.3%. I am not a bot‚Ä¶ yet."
2025-08-07,Story of my life. Haha. Always have bad luck.
2025-09-11,Can you elaborate pls? Selling 12/31 and locking in a gain vs not locking in gain in Jan? I don‚Äôt follow. I get delaying paying taxes and remaining invested but why not lock the gain if you need to diversity?
2025-08-07,"It can be ‚Äòif‚Äô. It gets to a point where you may not ever need to sell, and your heirs will inherit it when you die with the capital gains step up."
2025-08-07,I was saying ‚Äúwhen‚Äù the stock price hits 250 again

2025-08-09,"Yes they should be called out. But Trump isn‚Äôt calling them out, he‚Äôs using India as a vehicle to deliver more tariff propaganda through virtue signaling on ‚ÄúRUSSIA BAD‚Äù"
2025-08-05,Doing options isn‚Äôt investing. It‚Äôs gambling
2025-08-06,"More trading than investing, but the lessons you learn and the friends you make along the way are what really matter."
2025-08-06,What about the $185 call? Only a $23 premium and if you are deeper in the money you stand a chance on exercising this rather than having it expire worthless. You‚Äôre paying $30 premium with no guarantee. Better odds with $185.
2025-08-05,"Goodluck, been trading apple for over 10 years and it‚Äôs been disappointing."
2025-08-07,"You can make pretty smart choices with options. Volatility plays, theta play, hedging shares with covered calls for income. Albiet, buying outright calls is more on the gambling/speculating side of the house. I like iron condors personally"
2025-08-07,No matter what it‚Äôs not investing it‚Äôs gambling
2025-08-06,I‚Äôm also doing leaps and have $250 calls. Better return if my math is right. AI would need the hardware to work. No better player out there than $AAPL.

2025-08-05,"When exactly were we starting to rally?

AAPL had a pristine setup going into earnings, but blew it.

2025-08-05,India deserves it. It has gotten a free pass for too long.
2025-08-05,Apples lack of innovation on their best selling product YoY hurts them more than any tariffs

2025-08-05,People that care about short term gyrations shouldn‚Äôt call themselves investors.
2025-08-05,"Depends on your definition of short-term.

Apple is a great company and a long-term investment of mine. However, nobody can argue the stock has been a laggard, and for good reason.

Perhaps Cooke will come out looking like a genius for not spending hundreds of billions on AI like the rest, or he'll buy Perplexity and make everyone happy. I'm sure that in 2 years when iPhone finally has an intelligent assistant, it will be the best one. But in this market, holding AAPL has been an opportunity cost when so many other stocks have drastically outperformed it."
2025-08-05,I‚Äôve held since 1983 if that gives you a sense of my time horizon. Tim is doing just fine considering the trade and tariff issues. I‚Äôm not worried about AI. At some point I expect the AI bubble pops and the companies with huge expenditures on AI will get punished. Or Apple buys what they need when the benefit to the bottom line is more clear. Either way I‚Äôm not super worried here.
2025-08-04,"The idea that R&D spend automatically means profit down the line is false. If it were that simple, everyone would be rich. There‚Äôs a decent chance that all the AI spend won‚Äôt amount to much.

Most people who call on Apple to spend on AI won‚Äôt specify what that actually means and how that can be monetized. It‚Äôs easy to spend someone else‚Äôs money."
2025-08-04,What a disingenuous post. I like how you conveniently withheld any data on how much Apple is investing in AI. I find your obsession with framing the company in a bad light very bizarre.
2025-08-04,"Could be everyone else is over investing. Don't forget, Apple has the cards with the iPhone."

2025-08-04,I think Appl is happy with their cash and will just purchase smaller companies. They are looking to be a long term financially stable option instead of cutting edge
2025-08-05,"I mean Amazon's stock is tanking too. I don't disagree that AI is a big driver of growth but there are others factors, like tariffs for example, are in play here."

2025-08-04,"Apple‚Äôs style has been to let tech mature beyond the initial hype and then offer best of breed.

The AI game seems to be moving faster than maybe anyone can predict, though. Apple could lose or win. But if they win, they will win big.

2025-08-04,Point is they are investing so little and they are already so behind
2025-08-05,And? Apple makes devices for the most part. Them pouring 100 billion to make Siri slightly better doesn't make me want to buy their phones

We primarily use AppleTVs in multiple rooms. We‚Äôve got iPads, iPhones, MBPs and an iMac. If we had a home automation system that was easily controlled by our Apple devices, I would switch over to it."
2025-08-04,"Apple could do more to make the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù app better, but that‚Äôs not gonna drive growth. We don‚Äôt need Apple making and managing 20+ smart home products. Apple should only target products that individually can bring in $20+ billion of annual revenue (like the airpods). Those winner products drive overall growth. Vision Pro isn‚Äôt it. Apple has a history of making the *best* product. The iPhone is the prime example‚Äî smart phones already existed, but Apple reinvented the smartphone and the whole world copied it. Same goes for the tablet.  But both of those are attributed to Steve Jobs relentless leadership. Apple needs a product that takes AI to the next level. IMO, if I was Tim, I would be spending billions on robotics to compete against the Tesla Optimus. Alongside that I would see what existing product(s) could be reinvented given the advancements in AI. Maybe that‚Äôs the Apple Watch, replace siri with a LLM which completely controls the experience and your smart home. Vitals showing you‚Äôre anxious? Set mood lighting, adjust the AC, turn on music, recommend some action for you, etc. Hard day at work? Auto order an escort for a delightful surprise. Give your LLM a monthly budget and authority to make spending decisions. Tim needs to go trip on acid like Steve did and figure it out."

V\R has been around for decades and is still niche.  Cook has just ridden what jobs started with incremental updates since the iPhone and iPad. The M processor architecture was acquired.

2025-08-04,"I have a long accounts but trade 10-15% actively.  401k, Roth, cash account.  You‚Äôre right tho, I used to trade MSFT option when it was 150/share.   If I bought and held, I wld be up way more."
2025-08-02,Yeah that‚Äôs what I did. Lost 63k from options. I quit vaping geek bars and options yesterday. I have $50 in hood I‚Äôm just going to leave in spy shares for the meme and check back in 50 years lol. I use hood for TA when RSI is high I sell my tsla shares in vanguard and rebuy when it‚Äôs lower. I have 54k in tsla shares rn. Will sell prob when Tesla $650 in 1-2 years. ‚ÄúThe rich get richer.‚Äù Dont bet against Elon. I‚Äôm using nicotine gum and Zyns currently. Once I run out of Zyns I will just use the nicotine gum and hopefully quit. I do have some brain fog today from not vaping. I‚Äôll get through it. I have a small lawncare business as I do as a side gig every weekend. Making $210 today!!!
2025-08-04,10% isn‚Äôt bad if you‚Äôre ok if you never see it again and hopefully you‚Äôre trading in a taxable account and not your Roth so you can take losses on the losing trades.
2025-08-02,"You got a lot going on. I‚Äôm looking for out of favor beat down stocks. With potential, isn‚Äôt everyone? Tesla might fit that category. You are right don‚Äôt count Elon out. I kept saying that aapl should try to buy Tesla but it‚Äôs not very popular here. That would definitely bump the price. Never vaped but quit drinking a while ago. Drinking iced tea now.  Hang in there üòä"
2025-08-04,"Yes, options only in cash account.  I‚Äôll buy speculative shares in my Roth but never options.  For example, just bought USAR in Roth and more VTI.  Worried I will chase the losses tomorrow but nothing more than I can afford to lose."

2025-08-01,"because wall streets hates AAPL

AAPL just cant catch a break.  market rallies it sucks, market sells off it sucks more"
2025-08-02,"I‚Äôve been preaching in this sub. AAPL is a heavily shorted stock. If you‚Äôve been following the price action, it never holds its gain. You can also short it too. Make money both ways"
2025-08-02,"It is hard to trade stupid.  An underlying thing that gets very little coverage is Trump's interference in the Fed and the firing of the labor commissioner.  The US markets are considered A+ because we are stable and do no allow this kind of manipulation or attempt at manipulating data.  Trump is destroying that trust making the US market more risky by the day,  Money in general is flowing out.  Every day it gets a little worse and risk rises.  

There is a break from fundamentals because of this and trading is more gambling now with higher volatility risk because no one knows what might be tweeted after hours.  I wouldn't be surprised if you see rapid inflows in the futures market Monday after weekend news to make his buddies rich and leave retail options traders bag holding. It's a dump and pump scheme which is bad enough, but the underlying underlying fundamental are cracking, jobs are down inflation in rising.  We have not seen Tariff affects yet due to companies eating margin, pull ins to beat the tariffs and the Fed holding steady. 

If you want to look deeper this what I see. Companies start reporting earnings as they burn inventory showing raising cost to the consumer or margin reductions.  To compensate they start laying off people. Inflation rises in spite due to tariffs putting the economy in stagflation.  The Fed is stuck with info going in different directions.  They should hold the line.  Maybe though they aggressively cut rates without competent leadership, inflation sky rockets and the dollar crashes.  Eveyone says why would they do this.  Well just google who benefits when inflation blasts to the moon and rates drop."
2025-08-02,Potential buying opportunity
2025-08-02,Anyone who doesnt short Apple hates money. When it drops to 195-200 then you long it again. Rinse and repeat.
2025-08-04,Orange man bad! Also better question is why aren‚Äôt you buying more?
2025-08-01,Always does post earning report
2025-08-01,$RDDT is fine.
2025-08-02,Apple is down slightly more than the market. The respectable earnings were not enough. The trend is down for the market and Apple can‚Äôt beat that trend. The trend is your friend until it isn‚Äôt.
2025-08-02,Electing dumbass pedophile nazis is generally bad for the market.
2025-08-02,Horrible for the market?  Horrible full stop.  And really horrible if you happen to be a transgender air traffic controller.

2025-08-01,"I‚Äôm still convinced that they are playing the waiting game on where AI goes, as they do with most products/features. Foldables next year should be a hot seller. And inevitably glasses.

2025-07-31,Aren't you supposed to buy and hold?
2025-07-31,"theres no unique retail use cases for AI that Apple can capitalize. this goes back decades in Apple ceding the corporate world to Microsoft. they are a personal luxury brand that sells wonderful devices. they are in the business of enhancing people, not replacing them"
2025-08-01,if $aapl doesnt dip below $200 tomorrow i consider that an overachievement
2025-08-01,it's a hold now. selling CSP on AAPL is the move for me.

2025-08-01,Exactly. I suspect the ATH of 260 last winter was as good as it‚Äôs going to get. I don‚Äôt see any catalyst for a return to that.

Raise iPhone prices to 2k or take a cut out of the stock price? You choose"
2025-08-01,"Yes, they‚Äôve become incredibly boring.  Also remember when that was happening, when we all tuned in and watched because something amazing was sure to happen,  pundits continued to write that Apple was doomed.  I vividly remember around 2013 when Apple‚Äôs P/E ratio was around 8, and thinking the world had gone crazy."
2025-07-31,I'm still holding out. Maybe I'm too dumb to quit
2025-08-02,"Copilot uses ChatGPT, Apple is building the same thing in Xcode. Azure, sure, but that‚Äôs just hard compute, that‚Äôs not ‚Äòinnovating‚Äô in the AI space. Apple‚Äôs Private cloud compute is actually a cloud infrastructure that is innovative in the AI space that they committed to investing 500B into. You can tell me to wake up all you want but still not seeing Microsoft do anything even remotely unique or innovative in the AI space. Apple are at least positioning themselves to be the leaders in on device deployed SLMs that can provide meaningful use cases to device users (jury is still out on if they actually achieve that), but I just do not get what any of Microsoft‚Äôs USPs are that other companies aren‚Äôt already doing that keeps getting them branded as being ‚Äòleaders‚Äô in the AI space."
2025-08-01,"Quite the opposite actually im bearish on apple for the time being (could change if they improve)

I was a long term apple holder from 2015-2023

People can downvote me but the reality is i believe the next businesses that will succeed heavily are the ones that can cut costs by using AI. While not soley, Apple is mainly a hardware company versus microsoft being software focused"
2025-08-02,"Interesting. What practical day to day uses could these SMLs be deployed for on an iPhone or iPad say

Tbh running several businesses and on road/site/factory all the time mobile / handheld applications far more important 

I believe majority of people now like this

If those SMLs can be made to do something practical and useful that integrates really well I (or any business user, professional pr high net worth individual) will happily pay quite a bit a month to Apple 

Eg - an iPhone / tablet based tool for collating sales invoices and purchases, working out taxes/vat/gst, creating monthly accounts profit and loss,  

Basically anything that would make trying to work remotely / on mobile 

Adobe actually has a really impressive AI summarising tool just launched for summarising even complex technical PDF documents - something like this on an iPhone that can collate data from multiple apps would be massive"

2025-07-31,"It's tricky.  Apple's image b/c of it's AI story is in the crapper right now.  

Apple tends to be slow to adopt new tech (like we're seeing with AI), but when they do adopt, they have a history of doing it better than anyone else.

IMO, if Apple can buy a company like Anthropic (not Perplexity), who owns a leading model, or at least partner with them, the AI story for Apple will change overnight and we'll go right back to 260+.

Apple will HAVE to ""AI"" all their software to stay relevant, and they know it.

Even with beating EPS every quarter for the last year, it's always tanked after earnings.  Will this round be any different? Or will the market continue to punish Apple for not having a good AI story?

I dunno."
2025-07-31,"I have a significant holding. I think it's very tempting to look at the other mag-7 doing well and reconsider your position. I personally think that money will move out of some of those positions back into Apple IF they can fix the narrative. Ultimately, I believe they will because they know what's going to be needed to move the needle. The rhetoric is just so downbeat at this point and we are still holding relatively steady.  I'd lean towards surprises in the next 6-12 months."
2025-07-31,I have 5000 shares (since 2017). I am willing to sell 50% of shares if the thing goe wrong today.
2025-07-31,"I only have 80 shares, so relative to others, it's a pretty small position. Been holding since fall 2019 though. The run up until last year was nice, but it's been my worst performer over the last year. Even my s&p500, nasdaq, and total stock market etfs have fared better during 2025. I'm on the fence about replacing it with something else."
2025-07-31,"I haven‚Äôt found an ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô to buy AAPL at what i felt was a reasonable evaluation, at the same time that i had funds available for investing‚Ä¶.for the last (?) several weeks, i have had a limit order placed @ $206/150 shares‚Ä¶i suspect this week (today!) that order will likely be filled‚Ä¶to me‚Ä¶many people here (Reddit) seem ‚Äòbent‚Äô on investing the same way many of us re-warm our foods‚Ä¶in a microwave, instantly‚Ä¶i don‚Äôt see it that way however‚Ä¶there is a lot of talk here about the imperfection and problems AAPL faces and the difficulties ahead‚Ä¶i read ALL of those‚Ä¶HOWEVER, i have a different conclusion:

In my opinion, AAPL is not a quick move, it‚Äôs not a FAST play/return stock‚Ä¶it seems to me to be the quintessential VALUE stock‚Ä¶at times its lack luster appearance, it slow and consistent advances, (#think measure twice, cut once) approach can be frustrating, but it is also why the stock is so ubiquitous.

	‚Ä¢	APPL is for those who are PRIMARILY interested in: Longevity, Dependable Innovation at the growing edges of technology, not the bleeding edges, and perhaps the most important is AAPL‚Äôs cultural entrenchment.
	‚Ä¢	Instead of determining and seeking out the latest ‚Äòsugar buzz‚Äô, AAPL represent and is entrenched within Generational relevance.
	‚Ä¢	The Brand‚Ä¶seems only second to KO‚Ä¶it is unquestionably one of the more/most Durable brands (Often ranked #1 Globally in brand value Loyalty)
	‚Ä¢	APPL has a Low churn rate
	‚Ä¢	AAPL has a deep and wide Structural moat
	‚Ä¢	AAPL has Capital discipline and their financial structure support that fact
	‚Ä¢	APPL has HIGH levels of stickiness in the Application layer which is what that layer requires for success‚Ä¶because that‚Äôs emotional and technological

Despite the naysayers: IMO. AAPL is a deep foundational stock‚Ä¶.AAPL doesn‚Äôt have to win the race, AAPL needs to just keep running, and it needs to keep running, without ceasing‚Ä¶.it is steady with dividends (although arguably smaller), minimal drama, and its a stock that does its job quietly in the background‚Ä¶it just is, like the electric we all take for granted‚Ä¶Warren has said: ‚ÄúApple remains Berkshire‚Äôs largest holding and he has described the business as, ‚Äúan even better business‚Äù than his other foundational positions like American Express or Coca-Cola‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not a small thing‚Ä¶the iPhone is just a phone‚Ä¶its your wallet, its your calendar, its your journal, its your mailbox, its your camera roll of memories, health records, your children‚Äôs portal for school records, its your home automation remote‚Ä¶its also your digital identity in a two-factor authentication...APPL is culturally entrenched and generationally relevant. The REAL issue IMO is what your expectation are at the time of your investment‚Ä¶.APPL is a long haul marathon runner, not a sprinter‚Ä¶my portfolio is FINALLY matched with an opportunity to secure a deep position in AAPL at a value based price‚Ä¶"
2025-07-31,"Yes, I‚Äôve trimmed my position significantly in the past year. Needed some cash for life purposes, I reallocated some of it into 5-6 other positions over time. (BN, GOOGL, MSFT, ASML, SPGI). Apple is still my largest holding. I‚Äôll be honest, at the beginning of the year when I saw the other non-Apple large cap tech companies pouring all this money into capex I got nervous (I hold them too). Now that these mic-drop earnings are showing up idk what to think. I do somewhat see Apple as a hedge against possible ai bubble since they‚Äôre sitting this capex cycle out."

It‚Äôs not always correct but if Siri had that kind of ability and you could order it to dial numbers, write things in your notes, compose emails, it would be insane how much of an amazing tool your iPhone would be.  As a long term investor of Apple I‚Äôm grateful but I‚Äôm starting to wonder why they aren‚Äôt in front of this thing."
2025-08-01,I trimmed 10% @ 233. Holding the rest til I need it.
2025-08-01,My mom left me 27000 shares to manage when she died last December. I've sold 7000 shares and plan on selling more. Scary to have majority of shares in apple right now. Will probably sell 7000 more and let the rest ride.
2025-08-02,I actually bought some calls üôàüòÖ hope it works out. Imo positive to be on track with top line growth plus the AI commentary from Tim sounded positive too on the earnings call (quote: making significant investments in AI). In addition he also made a comment on M&A that I presume is focused toward acquiring an AI firm. Hope they announce soon a partnership with Perplexity or so that should give finally a boost to stock price.
2025-08-04,I‚Äôm holding so it‚Äôs a little rough right now what if I dumped every rough period
2025-07-31,Ok bye. Go buy a droid then
2025-07-31,"Yes, Sold 2000 shares at 215"
2025-07-31,So what's the long term goal? I have 4000 shares purchased 2013-16 and it's starting to feel like dead money.
2025-07-31,Agree completely.. just need them to say they‚Äôre doing something in the AI space on the earnings call and we‚Äôll be off üìàüìà
2025-08-01,Try for 150 is there is a negative reaction to the earnings report.
2025-08-01,"Super short sighted if you're not looking at long term trends. This stock continues to grow. Spends a year like a rocket, then trades flat or down for 15 months on ""the iPhone is dead"" and other bad news, then rockets for another 12 months. Just look at the long term chart. It's almost cyclical. Don't be silly and sell unless you need the money. This company is a well oiled machine that is publicly shit on and faces a negative news cycle to suppress it and then ride the next wave. The next wave is coming shortly."
2025-07-31,pre-2005 patience is not gonna give up now. I guess the only time to sell would be when the money is actually needed.
2025-07-31,AAPL will trounce the earnings and all the naysayers (short sellers) will stfu until the next warning. The cycle keeps repeating.
2025-07-31,It‚Äôs all about earnings at this point and it could bust. I‚Äôm thinking estimates are so low could be a nice surprise. Might even announce a stock buyback.
2025-07-31,In theory this is the best time to buyv
2025-07-31,"200 coming sooner than 220. What exactly does it have going for it? Hasn't dealt with tariffs, no AI and lack of innovation. All it has going for it is being a cash cow. Meanwhile MSFT/META moving nearly 10% off earnings beat, NVDA closer to 5T, & market just moving higher."
2025-07-31,"The longer the base, the higher the space. It is currently testing the investor‚Äôs patience.  When it breakouts all other stocks will look small."
2025-07-31,Apple has a significant percentage of the cell phone market share. Their tablet and computer market aren't doing bad either. As long as revenue continues to grow at a reasonable rate there are no issues.¬† Apple is a very strong brand.
2025-07-31,"Everyone here is wrong. 

The people saying it‚Äôs over for Apple are wrong. 
The people saying it‚Äôs have a Microsoft type pop right now are also wrong. 

The truth is Apple is going through its Microsoft stagnate era of 2001-2010. Not as bad; given how quick technology is changing these days. But still stagnant. 

People come here to find out about the next nvdea or bitcoin. But a few understand the vision of what it will be. 

And that person isn‚Äôt Cook. It‚Äôs zuck. But the good thing about apple is they will copy and win. And that thing they‚Äôll copy is glasses and the ecosystem around it. 

Forget stupid apple vision. Forget all negativity around VR. This is Apple silently working in the background as the market sees them stagnate. In 5-7 years Apple along with others will have AI glasses that are as discrete as regular glasses. 

This is the next big thing, where ai meets a tangible reality. People want ai in their ear. With access to vision. With ability to visualize for us. Something the phone cannot do. In 10 years it will be at least half the sales of current iPhones. Enough to excite. 

There‚Äôll be 3 winners of smart glasses and Apple will be one of them. This will propel them into a $350 stock in 5 years or less. 

Analyst are not smart. They aren‚Äôt innovative. They are always late to the game. They drive markets by brute force with their piles of cash. They don‚Äôt reward for innovation and that‚Äôs why they weren‚Äôt  in nvdea until the ai was slapping them in their faces. 

Long story short. Apple will stagnate for a bit longer. But when the glasses story starts making waves then it‚Äôll pop. 

No matter how hard zuck tries. He doesn‚Äôt have the ecosystem to win the glasses war. If you think not having the blue bubble was embarrassing wait till you see what they pull with Apple vision glasses. Props to zuck for pushing Apple though.

Cook needs someone to help him out. He isn‚Äôt cut out for this era of fast pace innovation. He‚Äôs critical for other reasons at Apple,  but he needs better help"
2025-07-31,Sold mine last week after I analyzed it shoots down every year for the last 5 years the last week of July. I‚Äôm glad I sold. Might not buy again. It was one of my weakest performing stocks
2025-07-31,"I hold only 30 shares of apple since 2019. I'm inclined to sell before earnings because apple said the tariff will add 900 million to cost of phone, also the new iPhone is not much of upgrade from previous so the upgrade cycle is longer. If they missed earnings it probably dropped over 20 dollars. China phone sales will be bad so does anybody have any good reasons to hold the stock through earnings."
2025-08-01,"So, all I seem to be reading about regarding how AAPL will be performing tomorrow at open, has a pretty bearish sentiment to it. Does that then mean, that I might aswell just go ahead and sell my 29/8 calls before market close today? Or will I be able to ride the IV wave up even if the the price might drop a few dollars?"
2025-08-01,tim cook should spend more time talking about home pod and emoji i m sure the AH price will pop
2025-08-01,"Overall, I'm very bullish on AAPL but I don't think the market reacts well to their earnings, I expect it to move to \~$202-197 at which point I will be buying calls, if it goes up tomorrow then I'll wait for the pullback then buy calls."
2025-08-01,It's been demonstrated AAPL is still a good business. Whatever happens with the stock price I'll be fine.
2025-08-02,"With   
  
1. Earnings growth stuck at 10-15%   
2. PE of 30   
3. Badly missing AI boat  
  
 [$AAPL](https://x.com/search?q=%24AAPL&src=cashtag_click) is dead money at best

  
Tim Cook is the Steve Balmer of AAPL"
2025-07-31,I dont feel good about it. But only because I have calls and I am already 60% down. But the way META traded today gave me some hopium. I hope AAPL atleast do break even for me.
2025-07-31,"When it‚Äôs this bearish and WWDC was like a wake, Apple just about told the street that there is nothing exciting coming. Perhaps there is little chance for more negative earnings surprise. Ofc, Cook could announce succession plans. Only that could send shares back to 160s. 
I‚Äôm optimistic we climb back toward 220 in August"
2025-07-31,If Apple tanks on earnings. It‚Äôs really time for a regime change. Truly embarrassing
2025-07-31,LOL look at MSFT and NVDA..AAPL last hit was iPhone so long ago 2007
2025-07-31,stock buyback would be bearish if not flat. They should probably announce AI acquisition or atleast mention their pathway to AI.
2025-07-31,They announced a buyback last quarter and we didn‚Äôt move
2025-07-31,Yawnnnnnnn super old news. What is new?
2025-07-31,"There have been persistent rumors about Apple's work on augmented reality smart glasses, but true, lightweight augmented reality glasses are still years away. What's feasible now is a set of smart glasses that don't have any display functions, and that instead rely on cameras, speakers, AI integration, and sensors to offer useful features to wearers.

Apple's first smart glasses will be an iPhone accessory like the Apple Watch or AirPods, able to provide auxiliary features to reduce ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå reliance. From Mac Rumors article"
2025-08-01,Hahahah you lost how much selling Apple?
2025-08-02,"Wasn‚Äôt because of the earnings but due to someone‚Äôs tweet. üê£ If anyone hasn‚Äôt bought into AAPL, META, MAFT, AMZN here is a perfect opportunity to buy."
2025-07-31,Tim cook made more money for shareholders than jobs did lol
2025-08-01,"Well it saved me losses on both AMZN and AAPL. It also helped me with gains on META. I literally looked at the trends for my stocks (AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, NVDA, and META) and sold at the same time they dive every year. I sold at $214 on JUL 24th for my AAPL. I sold META after earnings because they usually go up for a short time after JUL earnings before diving in August. I‚Äôm currently holding NVDA because they rise all the way through earnings and then sharply fall until October. So far, most of the trends I analyzed remained true for 2025. Buying back in on those stocks in October. Maybe not AAPL unless they show that they‚Äôre still growing as rapidly as the other companies."
2025-07-26,This is absolutely tanking after earnings.
2025-07-25,Low volume & too many selling at the close. Maybe a fund was exiting. It was a weird chart today TBH
2025-07-26,Well boys poor performance from Apple again to end the week. Flaccid stock while whole market bullish!
2025-07-23,Just sold them?  That was 7+ months ago he sold off 600m shares in but still has 300m shares and remains his #1 holding?  Unless I missed something today this is very old news.
2025-07-23,Does he not still own 300 million shares?He‚Äôs up there in age might as well reaps his rewards before the mighty one comes a calling!
2025-07-23,"Yes but not from just Buffet selling.
Accumulation has been rising into earnings in a season where even optimistic results are met with hard sell offs (e.g. Netflix). As an individual you don‚Äôt stand a chance right now. Shares are being bought up into 8/1 to soften the blow to whoever is worried about bag holding. This I could still see $230 but I‚Äôm more worried you‚Äôd see $190 or less before years‚Äô end."
2025-07-25,AAPL has done nothing for years while its peers have surged. The overall tech index is up like 50% over the past couple of years while APPL is in negative territory. Not a good sign.
2025-07-23,"No.

It's helpful to  acknowledge how long Buffett slept on AAPL.  He was late to the game and yes still made money but just b/c he's out first with a large share of shares, doesn't mean he's correct."
2025-07-24,hate to say but $aapl has become dead money.....
2025-07-23,I think you are right. Unless they come out with a banging flip phone or step up the AI game I think they get left behind. If this hits $230 I think I‚Äôm out.
2025-07-25,"It‚Äôs a horrible take. He sold very long ago. He is old and was taking profits before, handing over the reigns."
2025-07-30,"It's hard to say. But if you ask any seasoned investor they would tell you to diversify.¬†


He bought stock around the time when AAPL started to really pick up steam. If 5% of your portfolio is in a company and now it has grown to a point where it's 25% of your total portfolio you gotta sell.¬†"
2025-07-27,Seriously stupid moves sitting on a ton of cash only buying back stock and not spending on capex like at all
2025-07-26,Bullish
2025-07-20,Both are smart and no one can predict the future. Do you think BTC or AAPL will gain more? Make your bet and commit.
2025-07-20,"In the grand scheme of things, $1000 is chump change. Don‚Äôt sell to buy aapl."
2025-07-20,"These are completely different assets. It‚Äôs a personal decision that depends on your current assets and investing style.

1. Are you high risk high reward or safe with decent return kind of person?

2. Does $1000 mean a lot to you or is it pocket change?

3. Do you want to check and manage your account a lot or just set it and forget it?

2 = AAPL

1 + 3 = Bitcoin

I would personally keep the crypto. It‚Äôs a speculative asset with high returns. $1000 isn‚Äôt a big deal in the grand scheme of things and I don‚Äôt have much crypto. Now if it was $100k and I‚Äôm holding 100% crypto I‚Äôm going AAPL to diversify."
2025-07-20,"I just sold my Apple stock after holding it for two years.  I basically broke even.  I purchased more pltr, hood, ablvgo, and I am looking into data center stock."
2025-07-21,Sell the asset that has appreciated the most over the last decade for a stock?   The asset with the fastest growing ETF of all time?   No
2025-07-21,"I mean, apple actually produces value, and BTC is just the culmination of the greater fool theory. So yeah, apple."
2025-07-21,"I own Apple, since 2011.
I'm also in NVDA. 

I'd buy NVDA right now, before Apple.  There are changes afoot.  This is the first time I question what the direction currently is"
2025-07-21,"Smart? Debatable depending on who you ask. 

But swapping it for $HOOD and $COIN calls has been the move"
2025-07-21,"No, bitcoin is betters especially since it is only $1000

If you were talking a million dollars i would say apple as its safer"
2025-07-21,No one knows the future. But If you sell bitcoin now it's at all time high and apple relative low good entry price.
2025-07-21,"As a loyal owner of both, absolutely not. AAPL is a solid investment and will do well for many years to come. AAPL is not the asymmetric trade that BTC is. AAPL has not and will not outperform BTC. I should have sold my AAPL to buy BTC but I couldn‚Äôt do it because I‚Äôm a fool for diversification."
2025-07-22,Keep your bitcoin more upside for 1000 bucks. Apple is stable but it‚Äôs not a growth company anymore.
2025-07-22,Not to be an asshole but $1000 isn‚Äôt going to buy you enough shares that it matters
2025-07-20,Apple can create more Stocks to sell. Nobody can create more BTC...
2025-07-20,It's smart to buy more Bitcoin. Much better asset and fixed supply.
2025-07-20,"You‚Äôre in an Apple subreddit, so of course the answer will be yes.

However, Apple has been a laggard. While Bitcoin and leading stocks are making new all-time highs, Apple and its cousin Google are stuck in the mud.

That can change quickly, or not. In a powerful bull market like we are in now, betting on the laggards is a low probability strategy.

I‚Äôm keeping an eye on Apple for a catalyst that gets it to clear this consolidation and move higher, but until that happens, I stick with the investments that are actually working. Bitcoin has been one of my top performers and no way I‚Äôm selling any of it here."
2025-07-20,If you think Apple will increase in value more than bitcoin it is smart. If you think bitcoin will increase in value more than Apple it is dumb.
2025-07-20,Don‚Äôt do it. Bitcoin is rising yoy and aapl may rise a little more but it‚Äôs unlikely to beat it
2025-07-20,"No don‚Äôt buy AAPL. It rarely moves up and when it does move higher it doesn‚Äôt hold its gains, it pulls back immediately. I would wait till it goes back to $200 cause it‚Äôll definitely test there again. As it‚Äôs a major psychological level. The stock just moves very slow compared to the other MAG 7. If you‚Äôve been following AAPL price action, you‚Äôre  actually better off shorting it."
2025-07-21,"If the investment is only $1000, speculative is better"
2025-07-20,"$1000 is a lot of money for some people, especially if they're young. And ten years ago bitcoin was at $400. If, hypothetically, it has a similar future return, that 1K will be worth approximately 295k in 2035."
2025-07-21,There are better reasons to consider owning something than manufactured scarcity.
2025-07-20,"They‚Äôre asking what you think. Quite literally the point of their post, your comment adds very little value."
2025-07-20,Apple won‚Äôt have another return like that in our lifetime. Like pinpinbo said 1k invested in btc or apple won‚Äôt change much.
2025-07-21,"10 years ago nobody cared about Bitcoin and very few people knew about. Amongst those who knew about it, little cared to buy it."
2025-07-20,Terrible mindset. The point that it should be little. Someone with a net worth of 10 mil isn‚Äôt worried about a $1000 investment.
2025-07-20,"Outside of industrial applications, the same can be said about gold.  And gold‚Äôs price is not based on those industrial applications as it far exceeds what that would imply. Rather we all just agreed it is valuable and can be relied on to store value.  One reason we were comfortable doing that is that gold is rare (hard to find more to add to the supply) and durable (doesn‚Äôt react chemically easily and thus doesn‚Äôt get destroyed).  

So‚Ä¶. Bitcoin replicated those features digitally."
2025-07-20,"Brotha what!? Where have you been the past 16 years?? Also doesn‚Äôt that work with like‚Ä¶.everything, I live in Texas and one year the price of ammo went up, it hasn‚Äôt came down since because the companies realized they could sell it for that price. Does that mean you‚Äôll never buy ammo again cause the price when up? No, also how much more does it have to go up before you change your mind? What if it goes up forever? Is that still a ‚Äúfool‚Äù buying it? Anyone who has ever bought Bitcoin is in the green besides a select few weeks where it was above the current price"
2025-07-20,His answer is a very Reddit styled answer. That‚Äôs why Reddit sucks sometimes
2025-07-20,"lol the last 16 years I have been trading bitcoin to fools will to buy it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it has been a good investment. But unlike stocks that actually generate income by owning shares of a company, bitcoin is just a ‚Äústore of value‚Äù cause it‚Äôs limited. The truth is another crypto could come tomorrow that follows the same logic/rule and everyone could just buy that and drop Bitcoin because there‚Äôs nothing that makes Bitcoin unquie"
2025-07-20,"That has already tried to happen multiple times with forks and literally every coin that claims to be better than bitcoin, they all got one goal and that‚Äôs to be better than bitcoin‚Ä¶which hasn‚Äôt happened yet, so all your saying is you don‚Äôt like bitcoin cause it doesn‚Äôt pay dividends? That never what it was made for, it‚Äôs a digital p2p cash system, the point is to get away from corporations and governments not for dividends"
2025-07-20,"The point is any new coin could come along and take its place. Nothing special is holding Bitcoin up except name regonizition at this point. Nothing is backing up its price other than that‚Äôs what people are currently paying for it. I was oranged pilled a long time ago, and it‚Äôs why I made very good money on it. But the truth is, Bitcoin could drop 90% over the next year and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised in the slightest because nothing justifies its current value. 
Apple stock however generates income (I don‚Äôt even care about the dividend) the profit generated is what justifies its price and backs it. If it drops 90% cool, I can buy up a stock and own a company that generates as much profit in year as I paid for the stock at a 90% drop. Ofcourse it would never drop that much to reach a 1.0 P/E ratio but you get the point."
2025-07-21,"It‚Äôs backed by PoW and Apple is back buy the products it produces, bitcoin doesn‚Äôt have to do anything beside work and number go up, if Apple drops a shit product number goes down, if your not talking about dividends then there is nothing Apple does that bitcoin doesn‚Äôt, plus more. Ever person that has ever sold is a complete fool, you lose your position and I claim it and number go up, hasn‚Äôt changes its been like that for 16 years, the real dumbasses in Bitcoin are the people that sell. Look at the % change in the past 4 years compared to anything else. Bitcoin always wins, I know you can‚Äôt argue with stupid so I‚Äôm done here but I highly encourage you to dyor and maybe you‚Äôll realize there is no second best"
2025-07-21,"lol any crypto can do POW. Again Bitcoin 2.0 can come out tomorrow and destroy Bitcoin. lol Bitcoin is tulip 2.0, don‚Äôt get me wrong I still trade it because idiots buy it, but long term there‚Äôs going to be a lot of bag holders. You will be one of them haha"
2025-07-21,"People have been trying to make Bitcoin 2.0 since the inception of Bitcoin, not one coin/stock/house/metal or whatever comes close. As long as people are selling it smart money will move into it. Not a lot of things look as good as Bitcoin‚Äôs chart‚Ä¶I do like Coca-Cola‚Äôs chart though they‚Äôve done nothing but go up, but unlike Bitcoin you have to depend on a company doing good"
2025-07-21,"Yes because unlike bitcoin, companies value are based on actual performance. Bitcoin is based purely on speculation. At these prices I wouldn‚Äôt touch it. When it drops back to 60k I will pick up 5 coins and trade it when it rises knowing the risk that nothing about its value is real and I could lose my investment"
2025-07-20,"I got some LEAPS, looks like i need to sell ASAP on Monday open. Too much optimism."
2025-07-23,"I sold my AAPL shares. 

It‚Äôs been an underwhelming investment for a while. iphones are great in most ways, but they are outdated or slow to adapt in many other ways. Their laptops are great, but every year the competition closes in.

I‚Äôm not bearish on the stock at all, not for the near future nor for 10 years from now. I have an iPhone and a Mac. But is it convincing enough to think it can outperform the S&P 500? Not for me."
2025-07-21,It is never going over $220 again.

2025-07-25,Consolidation with high volume indicates the stock could be subject to large price movements on news?
2025-07-19,They censored Jon Stewart. No way that works.
2025-07-22,It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt understand the meaning but just learn the difference in buy vs by. Seems more and more people can‚Äôt spell anymore.
2025-07-19,"aapl is in an odd place.   On one hand,  everyone is expecting some new revolution with the next iphone,  but if it were to flop, they would be in deep,  deep shit.   ~1/2 of revenue is from iphone,  but the real cream is in the service end.    by and large, people sub to the services because they have an idevice.   As a result,  I think they have every incentive to make very incremental upgrades to the iphone,  while pushing hard with new fintech stuff / services in general..    I know  we'd all love some bullish, knock it out of the park iphone sales,  but I think holding aapl for the iphone is the wrong expectation..   the best case scenario is predictable, steady iphone growth with kick ass service margins.  And those services abso-100-fucking-percent must have a strong AI element to it.  tim knows it"
2025-07-19,Apple invests 500M to source rare materials and stocks remains flat when we expect to bullish. AI  can be a dealbreaker but nowadays we are flooded with so many ai app that I really don t know if it s necessary. Stock at the moment is flat when other mega techs are getting ATH.
2025-07-19,"AI lag reminds me of voice assistants and the assistant war.¬†

Cortana folded. Alexa got rebooted and is going subscription powered. Google is slowly replacing their assistant with AI.¬†

I don‚Äôt think this will turn out any different. AI is expensive to run in the cloud, and people only want to use it for search.¬†"
2025-07-19,"I have been in the business for a long time and just don't see the benefit of a foldable phone.  Alway 2 handed device.  Harder to access and use.  I do realize we now have phones with screens on the outside.

I can imagine them selling a few.  Like 5-10% the number of iPhones.  

Maybe there is a killer feature they will dream up..."
2025-07-19,"Apple users do not want AI overtaking their devices. Apple should take its time but also change this dumb management under the ceo, they are not innovative nor creative anymore. And their batteries suck."
2025-07-20,"Apple's late-but-better playbook is exactly why I've been watching AAPL closely. The AI concerns are valid, but their execution track record speaks volumes. I actually caught some nice swings on AAPL during the recent volatility around AI sentiment - was able to jump in quickly when I spotted the dip without waiting for funds to settle, thanks to Tiger CBA's contra trading featureÔºåthe 7-day interest-free period gave me flexibility to hold through the bounce. With the foldable iPhone rumors and that $232-233 analyst consensus, there might be more opportunities ahead. Sometimes the best trades happen when everyone's focused on the wrong narrative."
2025-07-20,"""Apple enters late, executes better.""

This is why I am still very bullish on AAPL, and not bullish on, say, TSLA. You don't have to be first to the party, just best at the party."
2025-07-20,"Apple always works backward from a user experience perspective. They don‚Äôt just implement a technology  because others are doing it or it‚Äôs considered cutting edge trend. 

From Apple‚Äôs perspective, AI is still useless from an Apple user experience. 

It won‚Äôt be until AI agents that Apple can leverage their on-chip security and ethos of privacy to make an AI moat. 

Until then, it‚Äôs trudging along with smaller AI incorporations and making sure their hardware and ecosystem is ready."
2025-07-19,it's falling behind.  foldable phone by itself is purely hardware play which i doubt has anything to do with AI.
2025-07-19,Apple is phone company. This does not required to spend money on AI infrastructure and AI traning.. Apple just need to buy and use already established AI infrastructure to develop Personal Agentic AI using the data it already has about us. I am sure it will come up AI frame  work for personal AI to be used by developers.
2025-07-19,"Apple does not execute better, it's customers are less price sensitive and they buy into the hype. With that I don't know how many people are looking for a folding, and if apple can somehow resolve the quality issues that everyone else has. Maybe they can.



No one bought into the vr glasses at 3 grand at some point they will price most people out. Looking at Samsung foldable it's 700 after subsidies, assuming apple is the same would you rather buy the next iPhone and stick with your pro iPad for the same money or can you get pro mini iPad + iPhone where the screen won't warp after 2 years.. Most subsidy plans are 3 years now.


And aapl has always lagged: 5g, wifi 7, nfc payments etc have all come in years after everyone else adopted. Their customer base does not care. In the USA they still have massive market share and no one is switching for AI, the apple to android switch each year is very small.¬†"
2025-07-21,When the AI bubble pops apple will be better off compared to other companies
2025-07-19,"Been using a Microsoft Duo for 3 years and there's no way I would go back to a small screen. Bigger screen = better. We're just waiting for a company to do it properly. Microsoft did, but the influencers killed it because of the bad camera."
2025-07-20,"Honest question - and it may not be every customers concern. Doesn‚Äôt every Apple competitor sell your data, by nature of being android or otherwise? Perhaps marketing is working but I‚Äôve had family with android/Google products and it just boggles my mind how much that isn‚Äôt obvious to them when it‚Äôs certainly a concern for them. Besides that, the amount of malware I‚Äôve seen on android devices vs iPhone is staggering. Or even functionality - somehow my family was able to delete the Google play store, and the best way to get it back was apparently downloading from a random host site. Everything else just seems so fragmented"
2025-07-19,Samsung foldable $700 where?
2025-07-19,"Samsung deal with a very strong trade I will get 100 off, +1200 in trade value.


At least the last time I checked"
2025-07-18,More garbage price action today.
2025-07-20,"Unfortunately, this won‚Äôt last what Apple needs. It‚Äôs a solid implant like a potent AI strategy that worked yesterday.  Still, I‚Äôm still holding my shares. Cash and in my 401K"
2025-07-18,"Even AMD has gained momentum. Been holding it and NVDA since oct 2022.

I've been holding AAPL since $54-ish, so it WAS great until last year. Now it just stays flat at best at around $210 regardless of it the market is rising or not"
2025-07-18,how long do you think tim apple will stick around?  I firmly believe all of this starts at the top.  I exited aapl two years ago and jumped back in recently.  I def have some hesitancy and like to hear all sides
2025-07-18,"I still have my shares haha but my is low 400s. I had nvda and msft longs i sold before they blew up and had apple..smh. Apple is poised to breakout soon but its just disgusting to look at trading wise, shares is alright if you been in for sometime and now isnt a bad time to buy under 220."
2025-07-17,"Unless I am mistaken, AAPL is still Berkshire's main holding and is a top three holding in some major ETFs like SCHG, VUG, and QQQ.

AAPL will definitely be back at $220. A few headlines about Apple lagging in the AI sector is not putting them out of business."
2025-07-16,"Isn't apple trading at 209.. Why would you buy calls if it's not going over 220 again..


I'm bullish on apple I think there is still a cult following that won't replace them any time soon, and I don't see Microsoft getting their shit together to be solid in the consumer space for some time.¬†"
2025-07-16,"‚ÄúI have *no* doubt in my mind that AAPL is *never* going to reach $220‚Äù.  Your use of those two negatives makes it hard to understand your meaning. This is what I think you are saying:

In your mind AAPL will NEVER see a price of $220. 
Not even ten years from now.
Not even with massive inflation.
Not even with more profits.

Yet, you‚Äôve bought calls above that level, which will only lose you money if AAPL * NEVER* goes above $220.

In your head AAPL will only ever go down from here?"
2025-07-15,Any news not related to AI or mentioning on AI is negative for AAPL. Stock will probably be down 2%
2025-07-15,‚ÄúThe trend is your friend‚Äù but only if you short Apple. I would never do that but still‚Ä¶.. I see it ending the year at about 230. That might be very optimistic. The tariff headwinds and the political climate are obstructing it now. We will see.
2025-07-16,Long term AAPL is a great hold and park stock IMHO.
2025-07-17,"Actually roll the clock back further, back to 1997 üëç

2025-07-17,"lack of true innovation.  when was the last time you hear from them with a groundbreaking idea/product/applications?

2025-07-16,10% in 2 years is grim and the outlook isn't good at all. I hold 4k shares and am starting to feel like a bag holder.
2025-07-16,"That's a lot of shares. I had a 5% allocation and have reduced it to 2% over the last 12 months. I'm technically underweight, but still want some additional exposure beyond my ETFs."
2025-07-16,Sell calls on your shares to generate additional revenue.
2025-07-16,"I bought a lot in 2014-16, so they've done well but obviously I have a huge tax bill when I sell. I wish I felt more optimistic about the future of the company."
2025-07-16,It‚Äôs a good problem to have. Embrace the fact that you only pay taxes on profits. And it‚Äôs only 15% long term gains if you are in the 48k-533k income range. This is assuming you live in the US.
2025-07-16,"Here‚Äôs the concept:

You sell calls, and use your shares as collateral 

Selling calls will immediately give you credit, also called premium (cash). 

If the calls expire out of the money, you keep the cash and your shares.

If the calls expire in the money, your shares are sold at the strike price of the calls.

Calls (for your purpose) have two important parameters: strike price, and expiration date. 

The closer the strike price to the current share price, the higher the premium. The longer dated (long expiration), the higher the premium. 

So if you want to generate some revenue and not sell your shares, pick a strike price that‚Äôs much higher the current share price. 

Risk: share price rises past your strike price but you can‚Äôt take advantage because your shares are posted as collateral."
2025-07-16,Thanks so much. Seems to make sense given the number of shares I hold.
2025-07-16,what do you think would be a realistic $ monthly premium for a low-risk call strategy for 4k shares?
2025-07-16,"If you do $225 for 1Aug, you‚Äôre looking at about 4k premium. If you think it might hit $225, go higher. You can also do shorter dated calls.  

 You can always close your calls early and keep the partial premium also. 

But if the stock price shoots up, you‚Äôll have to
Pay more than your premium to close the trade."
2025-07-12,I think more buybacks are more likely than a stock split at this point
2025-07-12,Last one was 4 for 1 in 2019. If the price can run to 300 on some news i don‚Äôt doubt it could happen again. Usually every 5-6 years it splits
2025-07-14,people should be grateful if $AAPL can hold the $200 mark for the rest of 2025....
2025-07-15,No chance of a stock split at this price point.
2025-07-16,Buy backs before split... 500-1k range you look for splits. 200 is still affordable for most people.¬†
2025-07-18,"Why would they split?  Splits are after a sizable increase in stock share price, supposedly to make shares more affordable for the smaller investor. Apple is down."
2025-07-12,"Stock splits used to be a thing when:
- buying fractional shares wasn‚Äôt possible
- you had to buy what were known as ‚Äúround lots‚Äù of 100 shares to get any sort of commission discount¬†

Now that neither of those things exist anymore, there‚Äôs no reason to split the stock beyond optics and illogical psychology.¬†

All too many people have no concept that a $30/share price and a $300/share price but with 1/10th as many shares is the exact same thing.

The dummies say ‚Äúit‚Äôs so cheap!‚Äù at $30 without realizing that they‚Äôve just cut the pizza into more slices. ¬†"
2025-07-13,When we‚Äôre at $450 again they‚Äôll split.

Tim Cook is responsible as CEO for risking Apple‚Äôs future moat; never mind his incredible succes to date. He rode Steve‚Äôs brilliant ideas, and did this very well and profitable, but added little.

2025-07-08,We can all hope for the best. Earnings at the end of the month for the last quarter.

2025-07-07,I think if it hits $235 we sell. $260 is the ath and I don‚Äôt see them coming out with any new explosive product or service.
2025-07-08,you should be grateful if it holds >200 for the rest of 2025
2025-07-02,I will upgrade my 14 pro when they release Fold style Iphone not the flip one. I am sure they will sell very well.
2025-07-22,"People forget how many ~45-50yr Olds bought iPhones in the early years. And they've had iPhones ever since, but now they're in the late 60s and even 70s, and their eyesight is terrible now. My mother is 80 and has a 14PM, and has the magnification so high she can barely fit more than a few words across the screen. A foldable iphone may solve a huge problem for aging iphone users. Apple knows they have a huge base of aging users and it makes sense that they would try and keep that user base for as long as possible."
2025-07-03,"The only issue I‚Äôve encountered with mine to date is the battery being degraded. I haven‚Äôt noticed any performance issues, app crashes, or bugs. I mostly use the phone for phone calls, social media, and Slack/Outlook, though.

However, the battery issues haven‚Äôt really been noticeable for me, since I usually keep the phone plugged in when I‚Äôm home and have a wireless portable charger for when I‚Äôm out (which I barely use, to be honest).

I‚Äôd only be concerned about the battery if I were traveling to a remote location without anywhere to charge it."
2025-07-03,"the fuck you're chirping about now? according to your dumbass logic, then you're a fanboy of whatever device you're using to dedicate so much time to talk about Apple on Reddit... in fact, you're more of an Apple fanboy than anyone in here. your entire Reddit account is dedicated to Apple.. lmao what a loser

also, whatever I‚Äôve spent on Apple devices (which isn‚Äôt even $3,000), i‚Äôve earned back a 1,000x over, since these are the tools I use for work. thanks, Apple!"

2025-06-30,"lol if you are referring to my single contract for the $340 strike (that cost $12) then I'm not sure I agree with it being full regard. 

Furthermore, I do believe AAPL has the ability to get back to $250 again within the next 4 months and either climb back into the top company in the world in terms of market cap."

2025-06-29,"Well I first bought AAPL at 666.00 so I‚Äôve been in it a while. In January of this year AAPL announced they had no interest in a search platform due to anti trust issues. While that fear may remain, what if? With their install base it would become an advertising monster. So the buy a A.I. company that could take them to achieve that goal and ‚ÄúOh My‚Äù..Someone will end up as the AAPL default if it isn‚Äôt GOOG. That said I‚Äôm just holding and will add shares around 190 if it gets there"

At this point you do still have a chance to exit with a profit, but you need to be lucky more so than smart.

I‚Äôd do one of two things:

1. Sell those now and take the loss.

2. Try to profit. Set a price of like $.75 a contract and let that ride. You might get lucky if we have a good day VERY SOON. If it runs to next week, these will be $.20 cheaper or so at least, you‚Äôre on the elevator down and only miraculous good news can save you."

2025-06-29,"Not that this puny amount matters, but what was the catalyst you were envisioning that would push AAPL to 220+ by late July? Only possibility is Trump doing a pre-emptive TACO next week plus some news from Xi about embracing iphones again (the former of which is honestly possible)."

I actually feel good about these, I don‚Äôt plan to hold them the whole time, will most likely sell next week. Historically Apple is very good in July, and there was 2.1 billions dollars worth of dark pool data AH Friday. I think this runs"

2025-06-28,"Complicated and up for debate. You have to form your own opinion.

AAPL has been lagging the mag7 for a bit, arguably due to their slow AI integration. Some think this is the right move, but a lot of investors want to see progress before buying in. 

I only own AAPL through ETFs. But if you think they are in a good position to grow their capitalization, then it's probably an ok time to buy. Support seems strong at ~$200. 

There are also potential headwinds (mostly from Trump's trade wars) to consider that impact their bottom line. DYOR"

In addition, Apple AI hasn‚Äôt been released to what we expect.  But this company has a huge cash in the bank. They are building and quite strategic of their releases.   Their highs were $240, so about 20% gain from where we are now.  I can see surpassing that by end of the year when they make announcements."
2025-06-30,"just some context if you invested in AAPL 1 year ago you would have ended up with a \~-8% return as of today, the worst performer of Mag7.  

on the other hand SPY gave you \~13% for the same period of time. 

Think about it."
2025-06-29,"The fact that AAPL is underperforming is not a reason for investment. In fact, that would be a reason not to invest. AAPL is not a current leader. The stock has gone nowhere while the leaders are at new all-time highs.

It‚Äôs a typical mistake when investors look for ‚Äúbargains‚Äù and expect underperforming stocks to catch up. While that may certainly happen, the likely scenario is that the leaders making all-time highs will continue to lead and the underperformers will continue to underperform.

There are many reasons to have a long-term investment in AAPL, but relative underperformance is not one of them. If the market rally continues, I would bet NVDA will continue to outperform AAPL. Leaders lead."

2025-06-30,"For me, AAPL becomes interesting at 175$. Until then keep on buying ETFs. If it becomes cheaper, then sell some ETFs to buy AAPL."
2025-07-01,"For it to become 175 you have to assume a bear market is on the horizon, and theres no evidence of that, infact it looks like we are in a bullmarket for the next couple of years"

2025-06-28,"Drop the ball on AI?

What is AI? A chatbot for now. Maybe AAPL doesn‚Äôt want to bloatware their phones with dumb AI that can‚Äôt answer questions correctly or do anything. 

I don‚Äôt want an iPhone with ChatGPT or Gemini or whatever you want to call it, giving me wrong, unvetted answers that are copied and pasted from random internet sources. 

I don‚Äôt want an iPhone that creates images that are not what I asked for, that are also copied and pasted from real art. 

Let‚Äôs face it, AI is a joke right now. It has no use. Its only use is being a buzzword to drive up stock price. 

Apple does thing right. That‚Äôs the company. It just works. The product works. 

Phones were here before Apple. Apple redefined them. 

Headphones were here before Apple. Apple redefined them. 

Tablets were here before Apple. Apple redefined them.

2025-06-28,It has been an embarrassing year for Apple.  At some point Tim Cook needs to be held accountable for the absolute garbage performance and dropping the ball on AI.  How the hell do you screw up Siri so badly?  People are a little too comfortable in Cupertino.

2025-06-28,"Apple investors don‚Äôt want to hear it, but it‚Äôs true. They‚Äôre way behind on AI and it seems clear they won‚Äôt catch up on their own which is why the Perplexity acquisition rumors are flying.

That said, since Jobs died, Apple is no longer the first to innovate new tech, but they are the best at polishing it and making it friendly for their exceedingly loyal fan base. It remains to be seen whether they do this with AI, but I wouldn‚Äôt count them out.

For now, they‚Äôre simply not a leader anymore. With the market at all-time highs and AAPL is lagging. I‚Äôm a long-term investor and not going anywhere, and have no doubt the stock will eventually recover, but for the moment, there are far better opportunities like NVDA."
2025-06-29,"> Looking at the bigger picture, since 2021 Apple has bought and cancelled nearly 15% of its equity, or more than one share in seven: $463 billion worth. This means when this buyback is done, in just five years Mr. Cook will have returned to stockholders a little more than what a Costco, Exxon or Mastercard are worth on the open market!

2025-07-01,This commenter sees the bigger picture. Bravo. Apple had stated its intention to eventually become ‚Äúnet cash neutral‚Äù in 2018. When share prices are ‚Äúlow‚Äù the best way to execute is to buyback shares rather than increase dividends. This optimizes their capital structure and pushes them toward the stated goal to balance cash and debt.
2025-06-28,"$212.50 is still far away from their ATH ($260).

I don't know that they would touch that yet since they even reduced the previous one after it was announced.

They could consider a 2 for 1 stock split."
2025-06-29,A P/E of 31 for this company is definitely a strong indicator. 6 bucks a share in EPS not bad at all. The buy backs will continue imo
2025-06-29,Volume and price are creeping up
2025-06-29,Looking a the daily chart it‚Äôs been consolidating for weeks if not months 199-200 is a great price IMHO and once this goes back to 229-230 we will wish we brought more.

Not the worst problem to have, but certainly some missed growth had I rebalanced and bought other companies that were hitting their stride."

2025-06-26,"I agree with the premise of your argument, but not the specific solutions. Apple's R&D budget is a mere $33B. Amazon is $90B. Google $50B. Meta $45B. They need to invest heavily in future growth and align more with their megacap tech peers. There is no question about it.

They have put too much emphasis on buybacks, dividends, and profitability; not enough on growth."
2025-06-26,"While other Mag 6 companies promote and attract investors with AI-driven products, Apple comes up with dead Hollywood which has been dead since Netflix.

They are both fucking absolute morons keeping the companies down."
2025-06-27,"I don‚Äôt think AAPL is going to buyout the competition on AI. They do have the capital and market corner to form significant partnerships with every big player plus saves enormous amounts in R&D as the tech grows over the next 3-5 years into mainstream adoption. 

AAPL Management got the message loud and clear that they better make AI integration work. My own crazy bet is AAPL partners with OpenAI, especially if oAI agrees to go for profit. 

I‚Äôd be curious if AAPL board members would even vote to own/acquire a car company like Rivian. That comes with a lot of risk, cost and competition that‚Äôs hard to manage."
2025-06-27,You mean like buying perplexity
2025-06-29,"I use apple specifically because they aren‚Äôt trend chasing plebs like Google or Meta. I don‚Äôt care for shiny new toys if they‚Äôre actually shit. 

Now yes AI does need some work but otherwise their products are so goddamn good they‚Äôre cannibalizing themselves. M chips are making it hard to not buy a macbook.

The ev market does seem nice but is it really worth it? Car market seems like a giant clusterfuck dominated by nonsensical trends of the US market stuck entirely behind the wall of the batteries. China also has a super weird taste. Is there a reason to have a Apple SUV?

Also seemingly only Wallstreet gives a fuck about AI. 90% of AI products are dogshit it‚Äôs still ChatGPT+few photo app gimmicks that people actually care for."
2025-06-28,they ABSOLUTELY should not by RIVN or ENPH and to even suggest that demonstrates a very suspect ability to reason.  A smart person would suggest they triple down on transport OS integration and buy or preferably make a much better version of SPAN smart panels.

2025-06-27,"lol blaming Alphabet CEO is absolutely disgusting and stupid. Look at how many great innovative products and services that he put out. Blame the gay EU Comission piece of sh*t that always find a way to fine Alphabet, including Apple. As for Tim, I agree."
2025-06-27,"Tim is actually exactly the guy you want right now. He‚Äôs an ops and supply chain wizard. There‚Äôs nobody better in the world to lead Apple through a time of chaotic, global economic upheaval and will-they-or-won‚Äôt-they tariffs that could quickly mess with component sourcing and manufacturing. 

The problem is kind of the 10+ years before now where he‚Äôs shown himself not to be a product guy and let Apple‚Äôs product lineup get to this confusing, bloated, unremarkable mess that no longer captures the public‚Äôs imagination.

In Tim‚Äôs defense, it‚Äôs really hard to find the right product visionary. The assumption was that Jony would be heir to that throne but it turns out that doesn‚Äôt work without Steve to temper his worst indulgences. And Tim‚Äôs first act was firing all the mini-Steves like Forstall. So there‚Äôs just a bench of leadership that isn‚Äôt putting out the kind of focused and innovative product that they used to. 

I still think it would be insane to call for Tim‚Äôs departure during this political administration."
2025-06-27,"Alphabet ceo didnt put out shit and still hasnt figured out how to monetize the things a sane ceo would have already. Look at a non profit like openai and look at google. Apple losing ground and android is still for google to conquer, all lagging"

2025-06-28,"They‚Äôre not lagging behind as much as you think. They‚Äôre not as good or consistent as they were when they were smaller, the product line is bloated, and they‚Äôre more prone to missteps. 

But AI for example, I‚Äôm not super bothered right now. Apple actually have had some excellent AI quietly helping you with photos, for example, for years now, but they don‚Äôt get any credit for it because it just does its thing, whereas with GPT the user experience is a more intentional, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using AI now.‚Äù But GPTs also still put out a lot of crap and there is plenty of room for Apple to come in with something competent and private."

2025-06-25,Remember how there were reports AAPL will be buying peloton? Circulating rumors because someone wants a payday
2025-06-26,"Apple HAS to do it, let me explain why...

Some context-- quick history on the largest companies by market cap:  
\- Railroads and steel -- changed the world for the general person (transformed how goods and people moved), gave birth to...  
\- Automotives and energy -- changed the world for the general person (made personal mobility and power accessible), gave birth to...  
\- Chips and conglomerates (telecommunication)  -- changed the world for the general person (connected the world and powered modern tech), gave birth to...  
\- Big tech firms (where we are today)-- changed the world for the general person (reshaped how we live, work, and interact), gave birth to...  
\- AI and Robotics (what's next) -- this will change the world for everyone more than all the previous combined.  We will be living amongst billions of robots (driven by AI) in the next \~10-20 years.

If Apple doesn't want to go the way of GM, AT&T, IBM, etc... they will have to position themselves for the next revolution, which will be AI & Robotics.

Perplexity is a fantastic AI.  Go use it.  They did what Apple didn't do while Apple was wasting time on the Apple Car and Vision Pro.  Apple HAS to catch-up to the AI race, and perplexity is a great way to shape their future.

The Apple execs are weighing ""build versus buy"".  Apple has not delivered on Apple intelligence promised deliverables from last summer, something isn't right internally.  The smartest AI talent isn't at Apple, and Apple knows it.

Plus, the market will reward Apple overnight with more than 14 billion valuation increase in the stock price (which is only a \~0.5% day).  IMO, Apple will skyrocket back to $250 if they buy Perplexity, I'm all for it.

Perplexity won't be the final play, they know they have to dive into robotics as well."
2025-06-25,"This is definitely bullshit news, perplexity is not worth that money and it‚Äôs a shit product that just uses other ai models."

2025-06-25,Apple needs to remember it‚Äôs a hardware company. Just innovate on that front rather than chasing the AI bug. Nothing revolutionary has emerged from their company in the last 5 years. Just partner with Google already so my GOOGL shares can moon. JK.

2025-06-26,"Increase in the stock price isn‚Äôt really a reward. I‚Äôd rather the price stay low so they can buy back shares at a lower valuation.

Spending money on this causes them to have less money and a higher valuation causes them to buy back less shares for each unit of their money."
2025-06-27,What?! Software is a huge chunk of Apple‚Äôs revenue. They have an entire software developer conference every year ‚Äî WWDC!
2025-06-26,"Look at Apple‚Äôs financials, they can generate 14B in free cash flow in less than 2 months. Perplexity would be well worth the investment."
2025-06-30,OpenAI is $300b
2025-06-25,How is there a race if no one one knows where the damn finish line is. Is it the deep fake photos we‚Äôre all tired of seeing? Consumer AI is a lot of Hype without substance.
2025-06-26,"Apple's always played the long game, but in AI, ""wait and see"" might not cut it. Buying Perplexity feels like a reactive move, not a visionary one. Hard to stay king without leading the charge."
2025-06-27,I mean based on this sentiment I would buy now. Share price has been trading sideways for a while.
2025-06-29,Apple is so 2007 and those the buy it suck
2025-06-26,"Feels like everyone‚Äôs sprinting in circles just to say they‚Äôre ‚Äúin the race.‚Äù Lots of flashy demos, not a lot of useful day-to-day impact yet. Still waiting to see where the real value lands."
2025-06-20,"It‚Äôs absolutely long term bullish for Apple.  Their chips are already well ahead of the competition and this will only help grow the lead.  But in a way this is quite obvious news, and I‚Äôd imagine every major chip producer is also looking to AI to improve  timelines."
2025-06-21,The bull wakes.
2025-06-20,IMO what would be bullish is the stock getting below 190 so we can accumulate more for the next upgrade cycle or when they finally get the right ai-integrated devices. If you're looking for a quick buck this is the wrong stock b/c the current generation of products won't deliver the growth the stock needs to break out strongly over 200.
2025-06-21,"majority of the users might not care what is really under the hood. 

wallstreet might cares a little whats under the hood but might not be enough to sway the stock price"
2025-06-18,People freak out. Just hold AAPL and you will be up. AAPL is always a long term play. Never short term.
2025-06-18,Shits been dropping -$2 to -$3 each week for the past 1 month. Who TF knows whats going on anymore
2025-06-18,"This loser stock is bending me over and gaping me in the ass. If you invested December 2024 at $260, good luck bro you'll never see your money back. Yearly return will be -19% in 1 month for this JUNK stock. So much for the average +10% gain annually for S&P 500, thought a wonderful stock like AAPL could beat S&P this year but nope bye bye -20% of my net worth."
2025-06-18,"Bought 200,000$ worth today"
2025-06-18,I‚Äôm in full buy mode!
2025-06-18,I would be tempted but went in another direction ($UNH). IMHO AAPL is a long term growth stock and when it grows it explodes. Keep going üëç
2025-06-18,I wish I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfully invested‚Äù in AAPL I would be all in.
2025-06-18,"That‚Äòs what I‚Äòm talking about. The ongoing buyback programm will shoot Apple back up.

I guess when markets relax, we will see some good news to please all angry ‚ÄûAI isn‚Äòt working‚Äú-Investors"
2025-06-18,"Yup, bought \~$1300 worth at $195 today. Apple is going to be fine."
2025-06-19,"I hate this stock so far. I only bought $10k but it's been disappointing. The leader team at Apple needs to change. They are now old, boring, and outdated. They have so much money but can't properly invest in AI for their phone. But I still believe it will go up"

2025-06-19,With all these buys on this thread it‚Äôs certainly time for me to SELL. Oh I already did at $222. I‚Äôm out for now. With one political figure controlling the narrative it‚Äôs too risky. Analysis may mean nothing in this case. I certainly could be wrong

2025-06-23,"If he cannot even type $200,000 correctly I seriously doubt he has more than $2 to invest."
2025-06-19,I also have $50k worth of google...
2025-06-17,"Just from watching the price during WWDC, there are tons of investors just focused on AI.  So, that disappointment is baked in at the current price.  If Apple does something interesting with AI, some of those people will rush back in.  But, I would rather try to look at the stock value assuming the AI-chasers are not in the mix.

I think the iPad OS changes will make that platform much more appealing now, which has been a fairly stagnant product line for a while. They will certaintly sell more iPads as a result.   The question is whether people will still be buying them to compliment their existing ecosystems or if that will cannibalize some entry-level laptop sales like Macbook Air.

If you think iPad sales will still be complimentary instead of cannibalization, then sales figures in the Fall should be solid.   Apple has been pretty aggressive on price point with the entrylevel Macbook Air and the Mac Mini lately.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a very slight marketshare bump from that.

I don't see blockbuster catalyst for growth, but still some slow and steady solid numbers.  Apple Vision Air isn't going to do it.   But, some hint of a high quality foldable phone next year might.

The 800lb gorilla is how much the lawsuit over 3rd party app developer fees hurts the bottom line.  How many developers will go out of their way to build in external payment methods over just working within the app store ecosystem for the 30% cut.   Or what happens if Apple decides to lower the cut to keep more people in their payment pipeline?"
2025-06-17,Its breaking that 193 this month and then we buy!
2025-06-17,Morgan Stanley has a high of 235 this year. I‚Äôm doubtful. Love Apple but concerned about the lack of urgency. All my products ask if I want to install AI? Hum! ChatGPT just shows up on certain questions on yahoo. It‚Äôs actually quite good. How does apple fight that? I sold all my shares after 20 plus years. I don‚Äôt know.
2025-06-17,"I honestly don't see what the big deal is with AI. Nice, I can search and find things a tad bit quicker if I circle something or use Google lens üò± cute... I've never once used Gemini (red magic 8s Pro) on my phone and I have never used Siri on my iMac. 


Siri is actually annoying because it pops up if I press my windows key twice while I'm mixing a song or trying to produce something, making me have to tap the button another 2 times to get siri off of the screen. 

Idk... I don't get the AI on our phone hype and I'm 24 ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è shits useless for the most part."
2025-06-18,Jumped in for more AAPL at $197.
2025-06-17,"Honestly you ain't missing much AI with phones. I have andoird and it has ""AI"" and the most I do with if is circle images to search and shit. Don't think AI will be a big selling point on iPhone. 

I'm bullish AAPL because WHEN IT DOES GET AI this baby is gonna ROCKET! And I don't think it's too far off.

Tim Cook has his hands full juggling tariffs and shit rn when the AI guy gets cooking it's gonna be good."
2025-06-18,Why now? What's the bullish case?
2025-06-17,"No conflict of interest that the guys sons are trying to
Launch a mobile phone and network and the guy is pushing tariffs and targeting Apple.  iPhones don‚Äôt need AI but it‚Äôs becoming a standard feature that this device is missing."
2025-06-13,"I welcome this change from Apple. Lately I have been using clear or monochromatic ui as I find myself less likely to mindlessly open and scroll. Apple seems to care about their users data, health and mental wellbeing, and not look at them as just a ad revenue generation machine"
2025-06-12,"What I hate is form over function that Apple does over and over again.  And mind you I‚Äôve had Apple computers for 40 years. So I‚Äôm not just pulling this out of my ass.  From a usability perspective, this is a nightmare.  Monochromatic  transparent icons are a horrible idea for anything other than aesthetic reasons.  Get a little bit older with poor eyesight, and you will understand.  Yes you like this design great more power to you, but I do not want anything transparent in my user interface.  Nothing.  I want completely opaque backgrounds to make things easy to read at glance.  Add to that different colors for say different menu bar items and I don‚Äôt even need to see the icon that well to know what it is for.  Apple has been trending away from usability for decades in favor of change for the sake of change.  They‚Äôve been doing this more and more in iOS the past decade and it‚Äôs kind of sad.  

There are two questions that you need to ask whenever you‚Äôre doing a design change that Apple no longer asks .

1. Is this better than what it is replacing?
2. How or why is this better?  

Ask yourself these two questions with any change before you commit to it."
2025-06-13,"Older users or those with accessibility issues can change most if not all those things under Accessibility. Let the new generations enjoy this updated UI. I actually like it and don‚Äôt find it difficult to read, it‚Äôs good to have options."
2025-06-13,Even in beta version you can go to accessibility and increase contrast and reduce transparency and it can solve the issue of readability (if a concern)
2025-06-11,"If you put **any** amount of $ into AAPL and expected some significant return in 1 years time, investing probably isn‚Äôt for you.

2025-06-12,2 years is up 9% and 5 years is up 136% so it‚Äôs all relative in terms of how long you want to hold
2025-06-12,"This is not the first time AAPL stock has been down in a yearly period. 

There had been four instances since 2015. There were many between IPO and 1999. 

April 2015: Stock fell 32% to $22.50 by May 2016, recovering to a new high by February 2017.

October 2018: Stock declined 38% to $36 by January 2019 due to trade war with China. It reached a new high in October 2019.

February 2020: Stock fell 31% to $56 by March 2020 due to Covid-19 concerns. It reached a new high in June 2020.

January 2022: Stock fell 31% to $125 by January 2023 during an S&P 500 bear market. It reached a new high in June 2023.

2025-06-12,"Apples reached its peak innovation. After iPhone 10 all they did from then on was make the screen and camera clearer with a slight faster processor, besides the massive price increases. They are at a stalemate now because they can‚Äôt keep selling iPhone‚Äôs for more because they have exhausted their last options. Steve jobs was truely the brains behind this company he had vision. These guys are trying to milk Steve jobs last move not reinvent new technology."
2025-06-11,What's the bullish case for AAPL?
2025-06-12,"Concur.. I remember the clowns saying Appl was a dumb mover at $8 back in the early 200's ish... Also, Tesla... It will fail, EV's will never be a thing. Here we are though. Haha, glad I just stuck with that gut feeling. Hell, $200 is Grand Slam on what was once an $8 stock."
2025-06-12,"You‚Äôd need to believe in the company producing new tech that was the back bone of apple all along. But what we are seeing now is not promising, they are behind in the AI race too.

Zero. Zilch. None. 

There hasn‚Äôt been a single product nor technology disruption like that since those devices. 

And like BlackBerry and Microsoft of yesteryear, who‚Äôd think anyone else could redesign a phone like Apple did. 

ChatGPT/LLMs are baby steps. If you see a bigger picture, you don‚Äôt care about those peanuts. 

Meta googles?  Nothing more than an inexpensive toy. 

Wait until Apple refines either technology. 

That‚Äôs the bullish vision on Apple."
2025-06-12,"Stockpile of cash, services are free money makers and a massive install base. They‚Äôve been ‚ÄúDOOMED‚Äù countless times, but it‚Äôs crazy to count them out. I trimmed down my position at $235, but only a bit because I was really overweight Apple and wanted to chase some other investments. But I‚Äôm not bearish enough to sell out entirely. They‚Äôve been good to me over the years. They will have their time soon. Foldables and meta ray ban style glasses will be out in the next year or so and those will be well received. The light phone will be trendy as hell this year for the basics. I know they‚Äôve been cooking the true reality glasses style headset in the lab and would bet they‚Äôd be the most successful with that out of Meta, Google, Samsung etc. I wouldn‚Äôt go all in on them or any company, but they‚Äôre a solid hold for the foreseeable future. They‚Äôre still like 17% of my portfolio including mutual fund holdings."
2025-06-12,"Faith based case is that they will continue to innovate in the future and protect and grow profits.  Expecting a company to be able to change the world year in and year out is a big ask, but I think they can make new technological leaps forward every so often."

2025-06-12,Apple NEEDS to invest in AI if they want to get ahead and they ain‚Äôt doing that right now. They have a HUGE ace up their sleeve by incorporating their own AI into all their devices it would solidify and massively upgrade their ecosystem into a complete autonomous ecosystem because all their devices are seamlessly integrated and very easy to use. The only way they can make this even better is with AI

2025-06-11,"There‚Äôs US 132 billion of short and longer term cash and securities on the latest AAPL balance sheet. There‚Äôs 15 billion shares issued. So less than 10 bucks cash per share. 

Leaves 190 dollar per share. Net income of 120 billion per year over 15 billion shares, or say 8 bucks per share. Growth is flattish. 

Do we think AAPLs moat lasts another 190/8 or say 24 years in this new AI world, where Cook has shown zilch and even still pushes Siri?"
2025-06-11,Is AI really that good or just able to handle some repetitive tasks?
2025-06-11,Definitely not a serious hurdle. But apple has been getting shit on on reddit for a couple of months now. Usually a good time to buy it up.

2025-06-12,"Just remember in everything including investing, ""This time is different"" and ""this time will be just like last time"" have no bounds. Literally anything can happen and we just subconsciously use these ideas to justify our decisions. It brings sanity to an unpredictable world. 

That being said, I understand negativity around AAPL. I reduced my allocation 50% about 6 months ago. Bought more NFLX and AVGO with the proceeds. Long term it should be fine. It's a company that waits for the next big consumer product and then masters it. They rarely ever use 1st mover advantage. Just leverage the ecosystem."
2025-06-12,"If you inherited this money, I find it fascinating that you had an attachment to it. It was never your decision to own it. Just your decision to sell. 250-260 is basically the ATH set in December."

2025-06-08,Sell the wwdc event. It hasn‚Äôt failed. Seriously when has aapl popped on an event that they‚Äôve had.
2025-06-08,I bought some more leading into WWDC. Also $200 a share around 30 P/E seemed like a great buying point. Anyone concerned with the 25% tariff on iPhones?
2025-06-09,"Apple is purely a consumer loyalist company. They make decent products, every single year, and all the same people keep buying them. When they eventually innovate in a big way again, the stock will balloon."
2025-06-11,"When they innovate eventually‚Ä¶.yes. But what if they lose their moat before? 

Are we confident at all that Apple software team can deliver on AI paradigm shift? Siri has been disfunctional since inception. Since two years, AI tools from OpenAI and Anthropic do things Siri should have been doing already, but still does not. 

The AI revolution ‚Äî it is a revolution: I build a SwiftUI game last night in 90 minutes, not knowing the language or APIs ‚Äî is going to give rise to new players that will rethink the way we use our phones. This is certain to happen within say 10 years. Will Apple be able to stay ahead? 

From what we‚Äôve seen so far, I am not taking a too positive note. 

So AAPL for me is 10 years of US 120b of net income, plus 130 billion of securities and cash on the balance sheet, over 15 billion shares say 100 bucks a share of value. The delta is insubstantiated hopium."

Also and most importantly‚Ä¶openAI is a nonprofit and they likely cannot sell a phone until they are no longer a nonprofit due to the nonprofit rules and an unrelated business interest compared to its mission. If and when this status changes, I don‚Äôt think the AI phone is a threat to AAPL. although having a product to sell  or license would be a good reason to make this change - they would still need a board to agree to transition to for profit or to alter the nonprofits mission  

Lots of things have to happen and lots of time will pass‚Ä¶ AAPL may end up being first ‚Ä¶ who knows. Although AAPL would need to transition away from its current privacy policies in order to have an AI to compete."
2025-06-05,"So it‚Äôs nice that Apple gets to take advantage of its current $110B buyback authorization at lower SP‚Äôs during these ‚Äútrying times.‚Äù This increases EPS while buffering the share price, and is tax efficient for us shareholders. AAPL is a keeper."
2025-06-05,"I sold apple at 212.2.

Apple was less affected by the China tariffs than the other tech companies which have rallied since the changes on the tariffs. Hence why they were less hurt from it initially and won't gain as much than the other tech companies.

Other tech companies like NVidia + AMD also have a lot of good AI news while Apple is floundering in the AI space atm.

Trump has also been seemingly bringing out back to back bad news for apple lately.

They've also lost a lot of potential profits from the multiple lawsuits + changes that are being forced onto their platform which aid the consumers(good for us) but hurts their bottom line.

I'm sure apple will grow in the long term, maybe some growth prior to the new iphones? But nothing too massive and I don't think there are short term gains to be made here vs the other tech giants that have great potential from non consumers.

One thing Apple could do but won't do is sell their chips to other companies - it'd literally be a money printing machine, but Apple would never do that.

But stocks are always random, maybe something huge comes out and the stocks soar. They've also been being beaten down lately, so it may just be lower due to all of the bad news."
2025-06-07,Sell weekly OTM covered calls and create a dividend while you hold.
2025-06-07,Still priced like a growth company when it really kinda isn't anymore.
2025-06-07,Sold all my holdings after reading Apple in China.
2025-06-08,Rather ride META to $850 by year end.
2025-06-12,"Kinda conflicted right now. QCOM, AMD are in my tech doghouse while AAPL is my next worst holding over the past 12 months. My VGT/QQQ have held up well in comparison while still giving me exposure. Wondering I would be better off consolidating to the sector etf or even VOO"
2025-06-04,I‚Äôve got a $210 6/20 call that‚Äôs up like 40% today. Only one contract so like a $100 profit but I‚Äôm hesitant to sell just yet lol
2025-06-05,AAPL tank on news that AI rollout in China has been delayed $BABA
2025-06-05,"It's a keeper, but the next 10 years do not look near as promising as the last 10 stellar years. Right now the only growth is what APPL is able to milk out of the services sector.  iPhone sales are still a cash cow but they've reached their TAM. Apple can continue to steal market share from Android in the used market which is still profitable via services. 

They really need to find a new business line. Advertising is the most obvious avenue for Apple. They scoff at the idea, yet it could be quite effective without diminishing the core product.

I have reduced my allocation by 50%. Still plan to be long for the next 5 years. I'll reassess if/when new information is available."
2025-06-07,"OpenAI is already planning to make AI mobile phone. If Apple does not come up with similar phone, it is cooked. OpenAI phone with its AI app will kill Apple phone bussiness with its app revenues. Apple can not even come up with foldable phone"
2025-06-08,"I am with you on that one. APPL under Cook completely lacks innovation. The developers are starting to leave the Apple APIs behind and are building web based now, leveraging the AI tech stack to do things Apple API‚Äôs just cant handle. AAPL is nowhere with AI. All of that means the Apple moat is shrinking, fast. 

Johnny Ive is on the case. You can trust that man to develop the next paradigm shifting gadget, replacing the iPhone ecosystem. 

I‚Äôd value AAPL at cash on the balance sheet plus another say 10 years of EBIT at current levels. No idea where that lands. More is gambling on Cook‚Äôs proven inability to innovate meaningful."
2025-06-10,Mr. Ive is 'just' an industrial designer.  It will take a far bigger team of innovators and quite a long time to create a product/ ecosystem that will come anywhere near displacing the Apple ecosystem in its current form IMO.
