2025-10-18,"Interesting headline, but let’s be real. “82% reduction” probably means better allocation, not less demand. Cloud guys love spinning efficiency gains as cost cuts. Nvidia’s still sitting pretty; as long as the workloads keep scaling, those GPUs are getting bought no matter how they slice the pool."
2025-10-19,"Seems bullish. Regardless of their claims, if software gets more efficient, it will spur wider AI adoption.

Which equates to more chips sold in totality"
2025-10-18,There goes NVDA stock price Monday
2025-10-19,Market is going up next week. Bitcoin account that shorted 30 min before trumps announcement is going long. Something might be announced this weekend or this week.
2025-10-19,"Someone posted the link to this website that you can track purchase orders, shorts, positions with a bitcoin address search. It was on the tokentimes subreddit in the comments"
2025-10-18,"Very good, will throw a party on this news"
2025-10-17,Liquidity issues and price tracking errors is why this isn't the best way to trade NVDIA. Please stop shilling.
2025-10-17,"I guess it's good to have options, but I have no reason to trade outside of traditional market hours as I'm not day trading and at the shortest swing trading around earnings which traditional market hours are totally sufficient for. I'd also rather use well established larger brokers to handle my trades instead of some newer or startup that mainly cater to cryptocurrency or tokenized trades. 

It's not that I'm against cryptocurrency uses and actually hold Bitcoin and Ethereum so no problems there but trading good ole' NVDA suits me just fine. $100 USDT credit is relatively insignificant too as my NVDA position currently is 6 figures, so that does nothing for incentives"
2025-10-17,"That’s a fair point..

liquidity and price tracking have definitely been concerns with earlier versions of tokenized stocks. 

The one I tried actually mirrors the underlying market pretty closely since it’s pegged 1:1 to the stock price with custodial backing, so I wanted to see how it holds up in practice. 

I’m not shilling  just genuinely testing how this hybrid model performs compared to traditional trading. I didn't mention it's the best though"
2025-10-18,We will! $200 soon
2025-10-17,Big investors are nervous for a reason. Retail are leveraged to the tits and buying the dip
2025-10-17,It’s just a good day to buy more shares guys don’t panic
2025-10-17,we are in a period where we need to invest in patience more than anything.
2025-10-17,Great opportunity to buy more before $220 by eoy
2025-10-17,Sell then
2025-10-17,Days like today is when we need apooroldinvestor
2025-10-18,"Hilarious how 5 days ago we were going to the moon, now we’re in hell? Just hold, we’ll be fine."
2025-10-17,WTF is going on? It looks like a sell-off tomorrow. What am I missing? Is there something that happened that I'm just not picking up?
2025-10-17,How’s it looking in two weeks I have calls expiring on 31 on Oct for a break even price if 182.70 which should happen but I’m aiming for 185-87 to make more money eventually it should hit high 80s end of month ?
2025-10-17,I bought this year at $89. I don't see a revisit of that level anytime soon
2025-10-18,I will take one for the team and buy your shares.
2025-10-18,It’ll be $200 plus within 3 months. Just bought more calls yesterday.
2025-10-17,"Hit correction 10% loss in pre-market.  

Why is it any bad potential for bad news even if it doesn't happen, even if it isn't related to Nvidia, the biggest stock sells off 10% before any one can process why"
2025-10-17,Buying opportunity because OpenAI and the Middle East are buying every chip that they can get their hands on
2025-10-17,Buying opportunity. The day to day price is meaningless to me. I know what I hold.
2025-10-17,Your right.  Sell your four (4) shares.
2025-10-17,What is over? Check 52WL and stop overreacting like a child.
2025-10-17,Coming back to Earth. My prediction is $98 a share by next year.
2025-10-17,I read some of these billionaires are selling 100% of their NvDIA stake. Why is that happening?
2025-10-18,"I'm not worried at all, just keep buying. I was too scared to buy it when it was in the 80s back in April, but I have no problem loading up on NVDA every week now."
2025-10-18,"im waiting for the dip of the dip, months of red"
2025-10-18,I am just glad I sold it in time and bought RGTI when it was in $20s
2025-10-19,"Sell!
I just added 10 more"
2025-10-19,Its green currently and so are most stocks currently. What are you afraid of?
2025-10-17,"This whole week was amazing bear trap and dead cat bounce, the crash is only starting"
2025-10-17,$200 RIP 😔
2025-10-17,Greater opportunity to buy more at $170
2025-10-19,"I agree, let him sell.  I hope more people sell."
2025-10-17,"Several factors are at play here. Today is Friday, and Fridays are often selling days because the market doesn't trust the orange man not to screw things up over the weekend. Then there's the ongoing shutdown and the resulting lack of data being released, and the market numbers that are being published aren't good. Then there's general uncertainty due to Trump's statements on China, the escalation with Venezuela and the planned meeting with Putin."
2025-10-18,"I believe $300 and there's  3 for 1 split. So, I believe you would be technically correct..."
2025-10-17,"Please... you are talking about the World's most valuable company. Yes, $200 is delayed for at least 3 days, but we are gifted with a terrific buy opportunity in exchange"
2025-10-17,You also forgot about the bad loans that was reported by regional banks in US recently. That has affected the banking sector and a bunch of other sectors pretty badly as they await more regional bank quarterly reports.
2025-10-18,"Yeah, the banking credit crisis.When you see two banks in trouble, there are definitely more than just those two behind the scenes."
2025-10-17,"To all of you freaked out by the 3 days approximation: 
1) I said *at least* 3 days  
2) The current dip has nothing to do with nvidia's economical performance as a chipmaker/solution provider (apart from that first 3% drop because Oracle went with AMD), it is for macro-economical reasons.  
As macro conditions can turn to their inverse in a second these days, $200 in 3 days is by far not impossible. Imagine, for example, what it would do to the price if Trump suddenly granted nvidia minimally restricted access to the chinese market..."
2025-10-17,3 days really? Love the fan boy vibes but $200 is cooked for awhile anyway..obviously it'll get there but not for months but I'd love to be wrong
2025-10-18,So if you get blocked does anything happen to you? Do you get a time out from Reddit?
2025-10-17,Yes but the bad momentum was initiated by Trump reigniting a trade war we thought was behind us.
2025-10-17,"Right….and we really think we can retaliate with cooking oil. Which we buy to convert to bio-diesel.  So we jack up the price with tariffs so our bio-diesel companies pay more, so the end consumer, pays more.
Brilliant."
2025-10-17,"We really shouldn’t be buying our energy, rare earths, pharmaceutical products from a nation that is anti democracy. We are hanging ourselves if nothing is done."
2025-10-17,"I am losing £100 every 10 minutes …

What’s going on ?
Not only this stock but 90% other stocks all red"
2025-10-17,"Bro we were at sub-100 just 6mos ago, 180 is perfectly respectable. It’s running a small discount right now, won’t last long."
2025-10-17,Really simple. China will get Nvidia chips with more capabilities than the H20 and the US will get rare earths. It will inevitably happen IMO. Buy the dip.
2025-10-17,"It’s because of the potential talks of a trade war with China. Nvidia is performing and the numbers show that, it’s just the uncertainty in the market. Buy the dip. Idk how long you have been investing but this stuff is pretty normal and been happening to Nvidia for years yet it always makes it way back up because they are succeeding as a business, the current economic and political tension don’t truly show what it’s worth."

2025-10-17,That price is old news. way lower now
2025-10-17,I just joined this sub and it's been eye opening. This is why people panic and make bad moves.

2025-10-18,"The whole market went down hard today , HOLD and Wait no other options for now , if you got extra cash laying around Invest and Hold , we all are in the same position right with Trump losing his mind with China again"
2025-10-18,Hold
2025-10-18,When is $320 price target coming?
2025-10-18,"are these post fake?  
Seriously  
that is a SMALL price drop and everyone is freaking out?  
I bought sold and held NVDA for years and some of you guys know that this small ""dip"" is VERY TYPICALLY because it has been on FIRE since the April Tarriff situation"
2025-10-19,"One must be a real dip-shit to panic over any dip in Nvidia and not use it as an opportunity to accumulate more. But hey, what do I know with my measly 14,000 shares?---->>> fast forwards to 50-Cent song titled ""Piggy Bank""

https://youtu.be/2DiPArF3RvU?si=0TeRib_aiGSUsayG"
2025-10-17,Even I think this time it’s going to the shitter. Orange man completely destroyed market confidence. There is zero bullish sentiment. I usually buy dips but I think I’ll hold the cash this time.
2025-10-17,You aren't losing anything if you don't sell
2025-10-18,"I find it truly fascinating, entertaining and every once in awhile you get a good insight or at least shows that they did their research on it."

2025-10-17,It’s green for the day today. But I bought them the last time that was a problem so I’ve had them forever.
2025-10-18,"I don't really care if it dipped, at least we can  use it as a trigger to buy more. if I'm not ready to buy more, consider making trades to cover my backend. If not sit back and wait for a recovery, there has been bad news before, we have had down days before with no real credible news, in a few days sometimes a few hours can make a big difference."

2025-10-17,I bought $1000.00 worth of NVDA. Oh yeah. In 2016.
2025-10-17,"In August, I bought 27.4 shares ($5,000) of NVDA at $182 a share. Not even two days later, the stock fell to $167 a share. That was not one of my best decisions. I chose one of the worst times to buy, but hindsight is 20/20. I was finally in the green by about ~$300ish when it hit $195 a couple weeks ago, and now I'm $20.00 in the red again. It'll go back up, eventually, though.

And $20.00 is nothing. I was ~$500ish in the red when it hit $167 shortly after I bought. I wish I would've bought back in April when it was $95 a share, though. I could've doubled my money by now. Up until August, I dumped all of my investment money into an S&P 500 mutual fund and ignored individual stocks, so I was unaware of Nvidia's April bottom until I looked into it when I bought in August. It sucks that I missed that train, but Nvidia is projected to grow so much more and so much bigger over the next 10 years that there will be a lot more trains to ride.

Anyway, as I've already stated, all my investment money up until August was being dumped into an S&P 500 mutual fund. FXAIX to be specific. I have 38.6 shares with an average cost of $191.34 a share in my general brokerage ($8,906.78) total, and another 60.7 shares with an average cost of $187.59 a share in my Roth IRA ($13,987.62) total. So, combining the two, I hold 129.3 shares of FXAIX with a total value of $22,894.4."

2025-10-17,"Guys, without given too much details but I am working as an investmentbanker in markets environment. Trust me, technical analysis is no crap and also used within our bank.

Für sure, it is not like you can look into the future but of course it helps (also us within the bank) to identify strong resists or support level. Of course with the help of the order book of our customers. But it gives as very good prediction what will happen when...

So, no bullshit but also not the one and only thing in the market. Because if this would be the case, I do not have the need to work.

Best"
2025-10-17,One chart to the other will never give you the same outcome. It is a birds eye view of the crowd buying and selling.m that’s all take it as past info and the interest in the stock. But never make decision with all these fancy looking jargon (only targeted to beginners). Pros read these and help their decision making in macro view not for day trading or scalping  like they show in this video. Useless.
2025-10-17,"I use technical analysis and i have grown my account 20% so far. The mistake in the video is that you dont just rely on chart patterns. You look at volume for confirmation, moving averages, RSI indicators, support and resistance levels. The more boxes checked the higher chance your trade will succeed but its never a guarantee. Cut your losses quick and let your winners run longer. Its possible. The only fundamentals i use is checking the price of commodities vs indexes s&p etc to gauge market sentiment."
2025-10-19,"when looking at graphs note the value near the bottom and the top of the graph, if it starts at 170 and goes to 180, a $5 movement can look really huge on the graph but it really only represents a 2% move in stock price."
2025-10-17,Try buying at the lowest price of the day with stop loss. Never buy at the highest price.
2025-10-17,"It can give you some insights on strength or weaknesses in some changes. 

It’s data that can be used but to your point it’s not a divination tool that can accurately predict the future and people that come up with ridiculous charts and weird markups"

2025-10-17,Most underrated comment on Reddit.
2025-10-17,"Absolutely. ""Past performance is not indicative of future results."" These graphs mean nothing. Stock price and trend can and do change significantly based on any number of potential conditions from new products or services, deals, supply chain conditions, competition and politics."
2025-10-16,"Technical analysis skill is not crap. Dare I say if you know what you’re doing, and are skilled enough, you can be a very profitable trader relying solely on technicals and avoiding fundamentals all together!"
2025-10-17,"This is the way, literature shows using TA actually improves portfolio performance.

But yeah those magic chart patterns aren't consistent enough to make any alpha in the long term."
2025-10-17,"How do I know the lowest point of the day if I don’t know how the day will turn out? Once I do know how the day will turn out, how do I got back in time to buy at the lowest price of the day?"
2025-10-17,They're like B.F. Skinners birds 😂 everything has a cause. My favorite one so far was this guy with a six paragraph explanation on Webull using technical analysis to explain why Nvidia was dropping And how he had predicted it. Guess he missed the truth social post coinciding second for second with the drop 🤷‍♂️
2025-10-18,"Ohh x company didn’t do well because of earnings…x company is overvalued…x company just bought out x company…x company lost 20k employees…trump just tweeted about, well fucking anything…..

You motherlovers are literally just guessing all day long,  praying some news doesn’t come out that destroys your portfolio lmao …..yall been saying stock market over valued for last 5 years….

Watch you some cnbc, all they do is guess.  Read the nvda forum…all anyone does here is guess and pray…

Come on dude…"

2025-10-17,"Yep. Its calculated gambling. 
Not for everyone. 

But never buy at the highest price of the day. 
And if u gonna do that, have a tight Stop loss."
2025-10-17,"Lol. I'm a profitable trader. I don't take courses, and I have excellent success building consistently profitable trading plans. Anyone who tells you they can predict the market is lying, but you can absolutely look at price action and create plans that are likely to work in your favor. And just to be clear, I drew the most recent bitcoin top to the dollar a year ago."
2025-10-17,"Lol this is something someone who was selling technical analysis courses would say.

Looking at price action to ""create plans that work in your favor"" is just another way of saying you're predicting the market. You must predict the market to make any money, no matter what words you want to use to say it. You need an edge.

The guy you replied to is correct, technicals alone will not work, sorry."

2025-10-17,"Without big money buying, the only upward pressure is coming from retail. The majority of the volume is currently due to hedging of options flows.  I think tomorrow is going to give a strong move, just not sure if up or down. I am afraid it will be down though, based on how the week is going. Most of the high beta names in the space were down 5-10% today, mostly bouncing only due to put walls. Tomorrow is October opex, so we might see a large move down across the market tomorrow or next week."
2025-10-17,$180. But good try kid. Maybe tomorrow.
2025-10-16,"Possibly. But institutions also know that NVDA is a major driver of TSM's revenue. If TSM is doing this well, then NVDA must be doing really well... institutions will buy NVDA to get ahead of that opportunity instead of chasing what we all know now about TSM.

That's why TSM is up 17% in the past month

The AI market will soar tomorrow"
2025-10-16,TSM is up at $310.40 at the time of this post...I hope NVDA will moon.
2025-10-16,Maybe but their earnings report will not have much of a fundamental impact on the industry. Keep cool and know that two years from now any moon or dumpster tomorrow will have no impact. Trade whatever you see in front of you instead of trying to predict how people are going to react emotionally
2025-10-16,"Well, von holding both right now. Hoping they both get a nice bump"
2025-10-16,"Well I have an alarm set in 6 hours and either sell everything at the opening of pre market in Germany or add to my position, depending on the news report and reaction."
2025-10-16,Rh has earnings up. Beat at $2.92 eps vs a projected $2.59!!!
2025-10-16,When is that? Earnings call?
2025-10-16,"If you think TSM earnings don't impact the AI industry then you are dumb af

Thank you"
2025-10-16,"Bro, look at the revenue growth on their investment relations page

It's lit

[https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2025](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2025)"
2025-10-16,Yes I’ve made 6 good decisions the past 2 weeks with options and lost 80% of my gamble money today alone on one bad decision. I’m done with options for now
2025-10-16,Rh has earnings up
2025-10-16,Looks good
2025-10-16,"AMD dropping already, not looking good.

I predict -2%"
2025-10-15,"You know, just from an outside perspective here you've got to think about what each company is doing.

AMD is, and I'll put it kindly, simply copying to the best of their abilities what Nvidia is doing. They are capitalizing, from my view, on the insatiable demand of the AI infrastructure build out. Their customers are purchasing their chips for 2 reasons:

1. They simply need more compute than Nvidia alone can provide.

2. They want to reduce supply chain risk from having a sole supplier.

None of the 2 indicate anything about product superiority in either function or economics.

Nvidia, on the other hand, is actively pioneering 2-3 generations of chips ahead of today, as well as building new connectivity solutions. They are also getting into new markets like robotics, simulation, self-driving cars, world generation.

The 2 companies are vastly different.

The concise view of mine is this: AMD is still a semiconductor manufacturer (design company). Nvidia is a general purpose, advanced accelerated compute company that is not restricted to semiconductors. They are deeply involved in interconnect development, data center development, software development, and AI application development."
2025-10-16,"AMD is a smaller company. It takes less buying to pump than Nvidia does. Both are great companies. There’s so much demand, much to go around. Nvidia is number 1. But in this game number 2 is still extremely profitable."
2025-10-15,Damn it. But congratulations to those who invested in it!
2025-10-17,"I’ve enjoyed shorting AMD every day this week, goes completely limp every day at 2pm like clockwork.  Lol"
2025-10-16,AMD is a joke compared to NVIDA
2025-10-16,Openai has placed a 26GW orders . 10GW for nv and avago and 6 GW for AMD . This would put Nvidia market share from 90% today to ~ 38% in the next 2 - 3 years . Although this 38% might be more in revenue than what they get now with 90% share . This analysis is only for openai and is not applicable to overall GPU/accelerator market . However this shows where the market is heading . This is the reason why investors are seeing a better growth in AMD and not in Nvidia . Btw I own both nv and AMD . No bradcom unfortunately
2025-10-16,"NVDA is constantly innovating. That is the deciding factor for me. 

I believe they will be the ones to really change our world.

Once that happens, everyone gonna wish they didn't sell."
2025-10-15,Who cares? Its all about money and fast ROI. You can’t hold to NVDA for decades to get better returns .
2025-10-16,"NVDA isn’t a safe bet though, they will be losing markets share, having their margins squeezed now they have proper competition, and that will result in a PE contraction. So they will have to grow revenue to just keep this share price"

2025-10-16,"Difference is available money. There is only so much money in the world. And to think there is enough to let a 4,5 trillion company 10x in the next 5 years as the guy here says is peak reddit."
2025-10-16,"No one's denying that Nvidia will go up. Yes, it 10 years it could be up 3000%, I don't know. But I expect to make 3000% on my cash in less than 10 years with AMD.

AMD's acceleration in it's stock price will be faster because of the additional AI GPU revenue it will be getting relative to it's current AI GPU revenue. 

We're trying to increase our returns here guys. Both will be winners."
2025-10-16,"They can do share buybacks also.

If there’s enough demand, which there will be, I don’t expect competition to be an issue for the next few years. Both companies will have space in the market and Nvidia is still very valuable for a lot of companies.

All I’m saying is I expect the stock growth price to be slower with Nvidia compared to AMD"
2025-10-16,Nv and AMD are almost till 2030. Broadcom is openai's design house . This will be a longer partnership.
2025-10-15,Who even know what happens in 5-10 years. You might not agree but many want it to go down. Paper hands like us just pray to go up. Big whales short it in every up move. Just see how it came to red after 2.5% up tick.
2025-10-16,"Wise you head mate, NVDA isn’t going to x10 in the next 5 years, not a chance, zero. They might x2 but AMD have a good chance at x8 or x10."
2025-10-16,"But thats what they used to say about Apple's market cap of $258 billion in 2010. Not enough money in the world, overvalued... etc...

Fast forward and we are now seeing companies breach trillions easily."
2025-10-16,"Acceleration in it's income is what drives increase in stock price, how much more will Nvidia's income keep increasing? We KNOW it's going to increase, but how fast? 

AMD's income we KNOW will accelerate faster than Nvidia just because it's so small."
2025-10-16,You want them to buy their own shares back at such a steep valuation… not great use of money
2025-10-17,"I don't consider Broadcom competition for this reason. They will not be on the open market just for openAI internal use. And I imagine openAI will never fully release from using Nvidia / AMD product.

  
Now that I think about your market share scenario, if we factor the above the deals with Open AI amount to 62.5% open market NVidia share and 37.5% AMD share. I don't think it will work that way open market but could be another perspective."
2025-10-16,That’s what the whackjobs who are heavily invested in MVDA think. They haven’t a clue what they are talking about
2025-10-16,"Is your argument ""Nvidia can't 10x in 5 years because the market of AI chips for LLMs won't grow 10x in 5 years?"" That may be true, but as one parent comment on this chain says, they're expanding into other markets.

If they can sell decent semi-autonomous robots for use in agriculture, manufacturing and construction, those markets could get it to 1.9T in annual revenue, which at the same P/E as today would make Nvidia worth 45T.

For context, current global GDP is 114T, agriculture is 4%, industry is 26%, services is 70%."
2025-10-15,"Check Nvidia returns over last 15 years.
Nvidia invents things. Invests in market that do not exist"
2025-10-16,Because the world printed money because of COVID and is drowning in debt. Look at the USA for example. The can can not longer be kicked down the road. Another round of printing and it's lights out.
2025-10-16,"They won't understand. 4,5t nvda doesn't go up on 10-100b news? Market manipulation!!!!!!1111"
2025-10-16,"It’s not a steep valuation IMO, if anything it’s fairly valued and will only go up as AI keeps expanding. The US’s data center buildout is nothing compared to what we need for the future, so there’s a lot more room there to grow. Every developed country will look to get data centers built and many of them haven’t even started. Lastly, we will see AI chips in EVERYTHING, personal devices, medical, machines, phones, computers.

Eventually the party will stop for sure, I expect chips to get cheaper over the years."
2025-10-16,You’re mad if you don’t think this isn’t a steep valuation for a company y that can only lose markets share and be forced to reduce their gross margins
2025-10-16,"Then you don’t have to invest bro. AI is no where close where it needs to be. 

Pull your money out of Nvidia and put it into AMD"
2025-10-15,It seems profit taking at open
2025-10-15,"Bro, it's been climbing for so long. A pullback isn't a big deal. It might just be setting the stage for an even stronger rally."
2025-10-15,+62% in 6 month… what a bad stock !
2025-10-15,"Its not. Its actually higher now after your supposed ""drop"" than at market close yesterday. It actually spiked UP on market open, not down. You misinterpretted it. It spiked 2% up, then went 1% down back closer to where it was before spiking. 1-2% is NOT any kind of ""crash"".


It went up on market open because the 24/pre-market trading platforms went up overnight. Those markets are more volatile because the trading is lower volume. Now, market opened at close to the higher rate it was trading at overnight, then ""dropped"" back clsoer to where it was when it closed yesterday.


It closed around 180.70. It opened at $184.77 because it was up overnight. It was only up overnight brcause overnight markets are more volatile. Your ""crash"" down to $182 was a correction of that spike, and still higher than the $180.70 close. There is no crash. Its up, not down."
2025-10-15,TSM earnings tomorrow 👀
2025-10-15,Switched to AMD couple months ago and my world what a good decision that was!!
2025-10-15,"It’s below the gamma flip. 

Negative GEX = MM buys put “Negative GEX (Gamma Exposure) arises when the collective positioning in the options market leaves market makers net short gamma. In simpler terms, traders and investors have been net buyers of options, forcing market makers to take the opposite side of those trades”

Positive GEX = MM buys call > upside. 

also, CTAs announced stock selling starting recently which everyone missed. So you’re gonna see downside within the month regardless if you like it or not."
2025-10-15,They spending money ... wen company's like that spend money it comes out the stock not there profits..
2025-10-15,"Calling it a crash is crazy, but yea as someone else pointed out, people could be taking profits"
2025-10-16,Bulls are tired it seems
2025-10-16,Been sitting on my 400 shares and ain't budging. Talk to me in 5 years
2025-10-16,"Crushing? Add more. This is a stock you never sell and give to your kids, as it rises and you have profits, lock profits in with stop losses. Best stock long term in the aI race,"
2025-10-15,"This is Healthy , so just HOLD like We Do , Next Year will be 👌 🚀"
2025-10-15,and then people see it go down and start buying again?
2025-10-16,Just got a $320 price target
2025-10-15,I wanted to buy amd yesterday but new to game and my euro bank invest section only let’s you buy massive certificates. Getting a trade app but damn missed today!
2025-10-15,The charts don't look good.
2025-10-16,"Am I the only one who is getting a little tired of CNBC jawboning every segment about “are we in a bubble?”. The company is printing free cash flow, it’s new chip is has enough demand that backlogs extend into 2027, they’re investing across the landscape of Ai in ‘best of breed’ companies, etc.
This isn’t Pets.com."
2025-10-16,Next time you’re getting a feeling let me know so I can short or sell
2025-10-16,Just failed earnings AVWAP for you TA guys and the October AVWAP.  Needs to hold quickly or we’re in trouble on the short term.
2025-10-15,"Upgrade from hold to buy. PT from 200 to 320.

Yee ha."
2025-10-16,"Can we please stop these daily “hopeful” posts? This is an investment stock guys, not quantum meme or oklo that needs to be tracked every hour or day. Buy and forget."
2025-10-16,"No it wont, we are down bad."
2025-10-15,You would be wrong it will be red at 830
2025-10-15,NVDA gonna make a huge move today I see it going back  to the $190s
2025-10-16,I’m going to attempt to counter this guys bad JUJU by saying holy shit! Nvidia is going to tank today! I see the t down by 20%+ easily!
2025-10-15,if he does some bullshit 30 minutes before market close again i’m gonna be so mad
2025-10-17,Nvidia is a buy and hold. It will eventually cross $200 so don’t put too much into daily swings. It’s a volatile stock but you will be rewarded by holding this long.
2025-10-17,Been holding since June and I have 10 contracts expire 1/16
2025-10-16,Think out 2 years when it's $250 a share man .... lighten up
2025-10-16,Sorry…awful week. I just want to get to like $300 or close and get out.
2025-10-15,Would this really make that much difference? Unless you hold thousands of stocks or you bought very early on. It’s already quite close to 190
2025-10-15,"Uhhh many of us on the sub do hold thousands or tens of thousands of shares? So, yes, it makes a fuckton of difference."
2025-10-15,I had 13 shares pre split now I have 281. But yes the growth is slowed now and I know nothing about options… but I look better than savings account. Something I know I will have there that isn’t going anywhere.
2025-10-16,Down $900k since 195. 🤮
2025-10-16,You don't like things on sale?  Don't you have cash to buy more shares?
2025-10-16,"I have 3,000 shares. No more cash for NVDA, no."
2025-10-16,I've got $280 million all together bruh ....
2025-10-15,Probably due to Jensen's mega brain stating that all revenue and reports are with 0 China sales. So we have that buffer
2025-10-16,"I am a long-term NVDA bull, but all is not rosy in this stock at the moment.

A stock that breaks to new all-time highs and then retreats back under the high for a few days is not a good thing.

Now, NVDA is clinging to its 50-day moving average, a potential area of institutional support. If it should close below 180 for any length of time, it would be a bad omen for NVDA and for the NASDAQ."
2025-10-15,NVDA investing into amd is so they can grab npu tech for themselves. Feel free to set your reminder a year from now when NVDA is touting a new NPU processor that out performs all others and we get to 300 a share
2025-10-15,Ask ai to make a breaking bad style skit featuring nvidea/AMD/openai etc
2025-10-15,Yes that is why I believe they’ll rise and continue holding the majority of market share for years to come
2025-10-15,Yeah I use it for work but never for Reddit posts. The phrasing and glib tone of the last para just stinks of ChatGPT. It’s boring to read. I like your overall idea though and I do recognise that was your original idea.
2025-10-15,Man get the fuck out of this sub I'll cashapp you $50
2025-10-15,$200 call holders 🤣🤣😂
2025-10-15,"I timed my CSPs and CCs damn near perfect. 

Only Tuesday and I got to close out my $187.5 CC's for the week and opened up some $180 CSPs (tho im a bit less confident about those)"
2025-10-15,hope i didn't buy the top at $185 (stocks not options)
2025-10-15,"Step 1: Buy calls when you think it’s going to go up.  Buy puts when you think it’s going to go down.

Step 2: Pray"
2025-10-15,"I prefer to sell calls and puts, less risky than buying options and hoping that the stock moves past your strike price. When you're selling you're hoping that the stock does not reach your strike price, because if it doesn't you collect a premium. Also, if the stock does reach your stock price, you can almost always roll the option out farther and with a higher strike."
2025-10-15,"*Nothing will ever beat the May 24 earnings call.*

I more than doubled my money."
2025-10-15,Buy 100 shares and sell CCs
2025-10-15,"Agreed, selling CC and selling puts is wayyyyy saver.  Limited upside but way better downside."
2025-10-15,Hmmm what is Taco going to do to keep fuckin' this good news up? I'm sure he has something more than tariffs up his sleeves of destruction.
2025-10-15,Buy longer dated strikes people. I don’t get the reason to buy 12 of a monthly strike when you can buy 2-3 of a quarterly.
2025-10-15,"Let it run until it expires. TSMC earnings are on Thursday, it might help a bit"
2025-10-15,No hope nvidia has been green 63% of the time last 30 days. Run
2025-10-15,Well.. you will need the market to only add $600 billion to NVDA market cap by this friday... what can go wrong?
2025-10-15,"Unless it rallies some what and gets to 190ish and you sell and get some of your money back, but no way it gets to 197.33"
2025-10-15,$200 by December
2025-10-15,"Right now in pre-market, it is up $4.70. I would hold it. I doubt you will breakeven, but at least see if it goes up more so you don’t lose too much money when you sell."
2025-10-15,Market value isn’t high enough to make it worth getting out of the position now anyway…
2025-10-15,"These were worth 5.00+ last Thursday open.   They were still worth 4.00 at last Friday morning too.


I assumed you kept averaging down?  Never ever revenge trade and leverage up a losing option trade.  That's a very good way to lose a lot of money really fast."
2025-10-15,Buying AI on leverage is hilarious
2025-10-15,"Asml earnings are today and tsmc tomorow.

Whatever they say nvda is going with them"
2025-10-15,"Sell 190 calls for this week expiry and get into 190 call for 45+ days expiry. 
Get the calls when its mid day low. 
Get out of 195 calls during opening and open 190 weekly short same time.

This is not a financial advice as i am not licensed. So do your own research."
2025-10-15,You got enough left to by a good rope
2025-10-15,too short runway
2025-10-15,"Ohhh found my buyer - Hello! 
I would love for it to be ITM but thanks for the premium!"
2025-10-15,"Greatest stock of all time, and you're swing trading it? I'm not sure how long your contract is, but please note that Nancy Pelosi typically buys options for over a year. 

Good luck and best wishes."
2025-10-15,"Patience my friend, I’ve owned it for ten years through many dips, it always comes back up. $200 in 2025🚀"
2025-10-15,TSMC earnings might pump it to 190
2025-10-15,This will keep growing. Bears trying so hard but they're on the wrong side!
2025-10-15,Thise options need NVDA to be $197 to break even and expire in 3 days
2025-10-15,"I’m doing this method as well with other calls. 

Always Hold until last min if there is hope to save $. 

You don’t loose money until you close it"
2025-10-15,These expire October 17 not November
2025-10-15,I lost hundreds. On paper. Can't relate. Forgive me.
2025-10-15,"Not quite forever, but the most stocks right now have options dated into 2028 so there are other dates available to roll to.  I recommend reading about options to learn more about rolling.  Sometimes it is good to roll and Sometimes to roll to different strike prices"
2025-10-14,lol I completely expected a drop in October with a potential opportunity to buy more dips. Wtf is Uptober? Historically even...what the fuck is Uptober for Nvidia? LOL Jokes on you buddy
2025-10-14,"Stfu 🤡 

With my obligatory address to OP out of the way, Im not worried. TACO and the fact these moves always allow a dip and then rise, its a grift. Long as one looks at it that way....and isnt American, its all good lol"
2025-10-14,Buying opportunities
2025-10-14,$200 😁🤣
2025-10-15,I think it’s an opportunity to start buying Nvda. I know Nvda for over 10 years and l know how the stock behaves.
2025-10-15,If you followed my predictions and posts on NVDA which are probably burried by now plenty of people have set reminders on it. This is a hold until 2030 at least. I predicted a slight fall off in September or October and it looks like October is a dip opportunity to buy back in if you have some free cash. 2026 we will see 220s in stock price. Set a remind me if you want and tell me I was right later like everyone else. if you don't I will for June 1st 2026.
2025-10-15,"Hold for 5 years while losing all sorts of other gains? Nah.
There are other stocks performing much better right now."
2025-10-15,I'm up 67% bud on NVDA alone. If you hold one stock that is on you lol. Of course DCA and have a diverse portfolio brother. NVDA suppliers have x3 and 4 nearly this year. So of course there are better performers.
2025-10-15,"August 1st NVDA was at 173. Today it's 181. That's 5% gains.

August 1st My account was at $176k Today it's at $206k. That's 16% gains in 2 1/2 months.

Tell me how holding makes sense again."
2025-10-15,"So you beat the SPY. You make $30,000 in two months and you're complaining right now? Make this make sense."
2025-10-15,Nope. Simply pointing out that there are better performing stocks right now. And holding a slow player like NVDA right now is kinda dumb
2025-10-15,I'm not sure how it is dumb to hold on a company with a bull valuation of 10 trillion by 2030. Would the stars have to align for 10 trillion? Yes. But 6 trillion is pretty much inevitable at this point based on fundamentals. There is absolutely nothing dumb about that.
2025-10-15,"I don't give a shit about their current valuation

I care about how quick I can increase my profits."
2025-10-14,Im tired boss
2025-10-15,Invest in both. AMD will always get the bread crumbs from NVDA.
2025-10-15,"Even if this were the reason, Jensen and every other CEO of a chip company is telling us regularly that no one company can provide all the chips for the demand for compute. This is a real example of the ""growth mindset"" in business... there is enough business for everyone, there is no one winner, can't be. People need to stop thinking of the AI chip market as a 'winner take all' market. AMD, AVGO, NVDA, even INTC (not to name them all) are going to be needed to 1. provide the compute and 2. work in conjunction to beat China in AI."
2025-10-15,Clearly tired of winning.
2025-10-14,AMD investors live in on copium your stocks at all time because the ceo gave up 10 percent of her company to sell gpus 😂
2025-10-14,"Yeah, people seem to think this would be a one dip situation. Until its resolved ....or perhaps we get OTHER positive news that would also 👀 greatly help the market and the world .... market stability isnt in the cards."
2025-10-14,"Crazy how Nvidia keeps outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7,  AI demand just isn’t slowing down. Makes you wonder if this momentum could spill over into related sectors like AI tokens too. Even on Bitget lately, AI-linked projects have been showing similar strength."
2025-10-14,Feast on what ? Is at $181
2025-10-15,I sold 2/3 of my holding at 195.11. I'm still grumpy about what's left dropping so much.
2025-10-17,There are way too many people waiting to get in on a pull back. People are wayyyy too bullish on ai and robotics for it to plummet.
2025-10-14,"Speaking of, is it worth buying the dip on NVDL (leveraged [2x] Nvida stock)?"
2025-10-14,"I have over 1,000 shares. And I’m feasting today"
2025-10-14,"NO. STOP. THIS IS WHY WALL STREET TAKES RETAIL $$ 

it's like taking candy from a baby. If you want leverage learn how options work yourself"
2025-10-14,Not bad. Im probably gonna close out my weekly covered calls early with this drop. I was flying too close to the sun with my 187.5s
2025-10-14,Why don’t you sell half at ath?
2025-10-14,Cool we’ll have fun holding cash haha
2025-10-14,"Because for the last 8 years people have to me to sell at ATH. Every year it’s the same thing, about it being the last ATH. I just keep holding and it’s great"
2025-10-14,Because we keep hitting ATH and it becoming a moving target
2025-10-14,Why not buy some amd? Looks like they would increase share price more then Nvda no? Like its amd turn
2025-10-14,Why not sell every Green Day and buy on red days ?
2025-10-14,Because there’s more Green Day’s then red lol
2025-10-14,"Because when you have so many green days - you won’t have enough stocks to sell OR 
You have so many red days that you are out of shares to sell. 

So people will do all this on margin - and now you know, where this is headed."
2025-10-17,"Because what you are describing is swing trading. It sounds appealing but statistically you are at a disadvantage to long term investors. I've had Nvidia since 2019, it's hit many all time highs. I've still never sold im up 400 percent. I won't sell ever. My children will inherit this stock when I die. Im 32

The only thing I do worry about is alot of these ceo's are getting older. I think in 20 years I may have to look to switch my trading profile into more s&p than growth stocks. I wonder who will be Jensons successor. Same with Tesla. When Elon eventually passes, how will the stock look.  That's the only thing that worries me about these companies, the ceo is so pivotal for their success. If anything happens to Jenson health the stock could see trouble. 

Other than that though as long as the fundamentals are good in the company I will never sell."
2025-10-14,same with soun i bought last month ish at 12.5$ we consolidated really well and reached 20 and then orange clown sent it to 16 on friday . climbed back to 19.5 and today its gonna crash again i think

2025-10-14,"Yeah I only invested $500 a month starting out but that did ramp up quickly over the years to $2,000 a month and now $5,000 a month"

2025-10-14,"We've entered an hourly downtrend. It remains to be seen if we enter a daily downtrend, or if market found support again near Friday's low.

This market is long overdue for some selling, but we will see if the bears can stick around for more than two days this time."

2025-10-15,Looks like this might be a hold everything until it’s over. Like 9 months ago.

2025-10-14,"Not gonna lie, the volatility this week has been pretty wild. I’ve been using Bitget’s stock futures lately, and it actually helps me stay flexible during dumps like this. They’ve got this Stock Futures Rush event running right now where trading NVDA or TSLA futures counts toward a $300K reward pool, so at least there’s some upside while managing all this chaos."

2025-10-14,"Won't be 3% off like the initial one. But might be 1.5 -2%, because it still needs to go back and revisit the Bottom on Friday closing. 

If double bottom and shoot, that's bullish, if it breaks, it's a flush."

It all depends in your objective. I have some for long term, and some for short term investing. Long term I hold it and keep investing till I either needed or I retire. Mostly retire, as I have an emergency fund.

But define your objective, or if you actually need the money right now…that would guide you."

Until I see qualified competition or other disruptors, I’m holding.  I’ll sell when I need money and then only sell what I need (plus enough to pay taxes). Or I’ll sell when I feel there is a “no-brainer” company to invest in. The rest stays invested and will transfer to my children when I kick it.

2025-10-14,Nvda won’t hit $200 until after earnings in November if we are lucky. You might want to just bite the bullet or you will be missing out doubling on Poet or Path by then.

2025-10-13,Bullish
2025-10-13,Not a crash but a price correction.
2025-10-13,Sell how many nvdas tmrw ?
2025-10-13,Not a total crash. But a price correction. Nothing will go to zero. But bubble will still burst eventually. At any sight if increased volatility Wallstreet will cash out. They always do. They dont operate on hope like retail traders.

2025-10-13,"The catalyst is Wallstreet closing sentiments on Friday. They dont really trade during late hours so most of the price drop before closing was from institutional traders and the slight stop at 180 only happened during after hours where its retail heavy. The price has been inflating for a solid 3 years without fail. Retailers always hold and get the rug pull from Wallstreet. Institutional money is what flooded the market this last year. They already made 300% gains and theyre happy to sell on that. They have too much to lose to increase their risk any further. They also know the Financials, the p/e ratios on AI bubble are record breaking in terms of speculative pricing. Why? Next week, it doesnt have to he next week, but it might as well be, but it could be next week or next year, the bubble has to pop, the financials are broken. Theres no products, theres no iPhone, theres no revenue, its all a promise of infrastructure overhaul that may or may not be as profitable as projections say, and its an overhaul thats supposed to take up to 10yrs to implement. Everything looks set for a major sell off from big money. They dont need Nvidia or any one stock like retailers do, they just need to make a profit and live to trade another day while they move on to other market potentials. Thats the difference between Wallstreet and retail reddit hodl'rs. Whats the only play for hodlers is one of a million for hedge funds."
2025-10-13,"Look all im saying is people on here should consider a market correction for AI. Dont get rugpulled. Wallstreet plays by different rules then retail. Learn to take a profit and live to trade another day. Im only posting this because as I read the threads on here im getting the vibe that theres close to no pushback, all I see is NVIDIA to the moon. Im not even saying a full crash just a correction to fair value."
2025-10-13,"Friday was a price correction.   You were 100% correct... In hindsight 

NVDA lost ~50 Billion from Tangerine Tornado farting in the wind.   There.   Tangerine Tornado flatulence = your AI correction 

Thank you for playing.  Come again."
2025-10-13,yeah i agree id even argue nvda has been inflated for much longer and has sustained but yeah well thought out post thanks
2025-10-13,No because I’m kidding. Hold through everything

2025-10-13,$SCWO was down 4 cents… now down 1 cent in a matter of minutes.  Feel like this could be a good week for it after the very nice run it had last Wednesday and then held up decently on Thursday and Friday considering all the bleeding

2025-10-13,Why would someone with 290 million net worth be playing with people on Reddit?
2025-10-13,So millionaires aren't allowed on reddit?...
2025-10-12,"Yeah, the moment you sell, the market goes up. If you don’t sell, it crashes to unseen levels"
2025-10-12,You regards…. Nvda has no sales in China since q3. Don’t sell anything
2025-10-12,Imma goin to sell everything and rebuy at 1$
2025-10-12,"Pay attention to the quarterly earnings call....they ,specifically, 2 or 3 times stated the fact that China sales, non-sales etc, ""were not calculated in the earnings report""  Stop it with the fear-mongering bullshit. Buy this stock and hold this stock for the long-term. Ignore the noise.  I started buying NVDA in 2002,  I have more wealth/money than I will ever spend."
2025-10-12,"If anything, next week brings buying opportunities!!  Keep for the long term, buy the dips.  Pass on to your children…Sell only if you must because you really need money and have no better options.  And then, sell ONLY what you need….and also enough to pay for the capital gains tax."
2025-10-12,I’m going to buy the dip when and if it occurs
2025-10-12,"⬆️ see it’ at least worked on OP to sell; shake out the weak hands; so many people bought this 145-185, will be 240 next year"
2025-10-12,"Do NOT Sell this is temporary, it will be back to $190 soon , Trump just decided to crash before Columbus day , long weekend in front of us so the Market is closed on Monday 💀 .

2025-10-12,"Guys, this is going to recover, right? I know this has happened many x in the past but damn, it’s exhausting. Negotiating ploy again? So much positive sentiment comes out, demand is surging, UAE, Europe, etc. I know the fundamentals haven’t changed but the back-and-forth good and bad stories are just such damn mind-fucks."
2025-10-13,It you are holding shares do not sell. Stop this fear mongering nonsense. The stocks may go down but they will sky rocket when all is over
2025-10-13,"It's Sunday so you can't sell now, and if everything's over tomorrow well then it will be too late when you sell. So what's your point?"
2025-10-13,"I just sold my stock, it's gonna be April again. Buy the dip later"
2025-10-13,The market always recovers higher than it pulls back. I only sell if I need cash first something. And I never sell when the market is on a pull back. Have patience. Do not act on emotion/fear.
2025-10-14,"Please drop please, so I can buy"
2025-10-14,184 was the point to cross and it did!!! Next stop 200. The rest is NOISE. Buy noise cancellation headsets if you want to invest long and gain. Or be another slave to algorithmic computing.
2025-10-15,"Stop panicking, it dropped to under $90 in April and many people that sold lost out on doubling their money since then. There will be ups and downs but Nvidia is a long term winner."
2025-10-19,New news: Nvda sells 100billion worth of new chips. Trump allows sales to china and we will be at 300$ a share. Nvda is a buy and hold for life stock.
2025-10-12,Thats the way the algos are programmed to react. So do the opposite of the masses. So if the masses  start buying the dip it will keep dipping after a short pop head fake of a lower high. If the masses continue selling it will run up after the higher low.
2025-10-13,"yup, when people buy, it will drop. When they sell it will go up."
2025-10-15,"Yeah, it almost always happens like that. Unless you’re one of people on here claiming they turned 100k into 100mil on “Race To $10 mil”"
2025-10-12,"It’s perhaps worries about supply chain on rare earth and increased costs down the like if tensions increase. TBH, it’s a gross overreaction"
2025-10-13,Nvidia accounts $0 sale to China going foward since the last report I believe
2025-10-12,That means no gains either. So best to sell.
2025-10-12,"Legal ones aren't, rumors say as much as 40% of current sales are back door to China. I don't think it's anywhere near that and to be sure I'm still long Nvidia because I think demand still outstrips supply. If Chinese companies don't buy them to smuggle in they'll be sold elsewhere. But there's a chance this could effect earnings"
2025-10-12,"1$ is too high of a valuation, I was thinking .50$"
2025-10-12,At what point do you profit to use it if you buy only. U borrow against it?
2025-10-12,Then why are you bothered by this fear monger post? Its the perfect opportunity to buy up cheaper when it drops.
2025-10-13,Bad moveeeee
2025-10-13,OH SNAP!  Like I said. Thank you sellers.
2025-10-12,"Everything and all news coming from China is always intended to cause fear.


This is where smart money purchases oversold stocks for no reason such as Nvda and I will even add Amd into the mix simply because both companies have no interest in China and the markets have already baked that into the stock as I said… since q3."
2025-10-13,"Yes, that is correct. Here is a great interview with Cramer. I absolutely think every Nvda investor should watch and be well informed. 

https://youtu.be/Fz4mLwW5Rx0"
2025-10-12,T actual F….. wtf….. u know what sell your Nvda stock I’ll buy it right away.
2025-10-12,"I was actually moments away from selling at $195, received a call and missed it. I knew something was going to tear it down even if it was by $7 with profit taking on a Friday. Had the same feeling Jan 6th and hesitated for greed 🫠"
2025-10-12,Sure thing. Ill have $$$ while youre at zero lol
2025-10-12,"Well I’m sorry you didn’t sell at 195… however, I am confident that it will get to that and more shortly. 

Nvda is a safe stock. It is positioned for any type of market fluctuations. I have been trading since 2008 and the bulk of my profits come from Nvda. 

I bought the ah dip so hard btw."
2025-10-12,yeah sell your stock and then cry about it when it gets to $210
2025-10-12,Oh without doubt! This was only a swing trade to use the capital and buy more
2025-10-12,"Swing trade you buffoon. I’m long term 😆
So few braincells downvoting missing the point. I always buy in"
2025-10-12,"His net worth is around $170 billion

Selling 75k shares for $13.5 million is nothing for him

That's $405 million in a month, which is less than 0.5% of his net worth

Costco has a higher PE ratio, their revenue only grew 8% Y/Y in the most recent report, and their stock is only up 2% in the past year

Nvidia revenue in the most recent report grew by 55% Y/Y and the stock is up 32% YTD

You literally have to be dumb to sell Nvidia to buy Costco because Jensen Huang wanted to buy a beach house"
2025-10-12,"These jensen selling share posts are stupid. All CEOs have regular planned sell plans Bill Gates ,Larry Ellison , Jeff Besos, etc.  all do the same. What’s the freaking deal to post these ?"
2025-10-12,"Its 75,000 shares times 15 days. So around a quarter billy. Still nothing. He just wants a new car or something."
2025-10-12,Well I’m only selling 20 shares I’m not selling all my positions. Costco might not have the revenue or profit that Nvidia has but it has stability. One bad tweet from the president can crash the Nvidia price. But people will always go to Costco. Name brand with world wide recognition and not really impacted by tariffs a whole lot cause revenue is made from memberships world wide mean you.
2025-10-12,Relax pal I’m not out here panicking like other people are I know what he’s doing. Just wanted to see what the Reddit community thinks. Guess I was mistaken.
2025-10-13,"No it isn't, sorry

You sound like a delusional MSTY bag holder, eh?

What's Nvidia's total return YTD compared to the MSTY rat poison that you bought on margin

Bankruptcy?"
2025-10-12,Peace of mind is where it’s at. Do what makes you sleep well at night. Good luck!
2025-10-12,He's Dollar Sell Averaging
2025-10-12,Ehhh mostly just cashing out some liquid to gamble but the Costco stock for sure will be more of a long term hold. Plenty of opportunities to short some markets. Might as well use the houses money.
2025-10-13,"nah, i don't own that trash

Good luck!"
2025-10-12,I’d hold…
2025-10-12,If I was smoking crack I would probably sell nvidia for Costco too. Goodluck!!
2025-10-13,"He's selling Nvidia to buy an asset that will obviously underperform Nvidia

Why tf would you want to make less money?

The point of investing in the stock market is to make as much money as possible while managing risk exposure

Nvidia will obviously outperform Costco, so it would be insanely dumb to sell Nvidia and buy Costco, which is barely growing it's revenue, while we are at the very beginning of the AI revolution which Nvidia has a 95% market share on"
2025-10-12,If I was smoking crack I would take stock advice from someone on Reddit. Thanks for the encouragement though pal.
2025-10-11,Ahhh it’s an opportunity to Buy!  DCA
2025-10-12,Because Jensen has sold off 1% (750k) of his shares over the course of a month and Trump threw a tantrum after he didn't win the Nobel.
2025-10-12,I personally think there are alot of people looking for an excuse to take some profits and the market is probably a little over heated anyway
2025-10-12,Is it a good time to buy? What do you think?
2025-10-12,Let's see if it goes down to 100...might get 10 shares lol
2025-10-12, Will be green monday
2025-10-12,People taking profits
2025-10-12,"Wait until after November 1 to buy any more stocks. That’s when the China tariff is set to take effect. If it goes through, most stocks will likely drop sharply, then you can buy as much as you can afford. It’s amazing how so many people just follow the crowd like sheep, especially with NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA is a solid investment, but there are much better opportunities in the market. And don’t rely on mainstream media for financial news,they’re all biased."
2025-10-14,I got bad news for you tomorrow
2025-10-12,"Nah dude it's over, this is the beginning of the downtrend to $100"
2025-10-12,"Set up DCA and stop loss, delete reddit, go outside and touch grass for 5-10 years: The Meta"
2025-10-12,"Retail investors can at the absolute most move a large stock like nvidia by 2-5% if there is huge hype or fear. Don’t try and imagine the psychology of the average investor when looking at nvidia, it’s basically fully controlled by institutional investors like hedge funds etc."
2025-10-12,Jk obviously it's just an opportunity to buy more 
2025-10-12,Help? Breaking everything makes it easier to buy everything in the fire sale and set up internal military control to squash civilian dissent. It’s an oligarchic kleptocracy now. Get used to it.
2025-10-12,We’re looking at the royalty of creating failure. The fact that the knowledge is foretold explains much about the MX constitution that we govern with in all of North America. USA doesn’t get tired of flexing its trash.
2025-10-11,It’s still somewhat range bound and easily could move back up $10 a share and that is tradable
2025-10-11,No way is going to $200 by EOW. I’d be happy if we see $190 and even that is just a hope…this is a volatile stock. Remember it went to $80 in April….
2025-10-11,How longs a piece of string?
2025-10-14,"NVDA’s been unpredictable lately, but I’ve been trading it on Bitget’s stock futures instead of spot. Keeps things lighter on capital and lets me react faster. There’s even a *Stock Futures Rush* event this week where trading popular pairs contributes to a $300K NVDA tokenized reward pool, so it’s been fun tracking the swings while staying active."
2025-10-11,"this news will affecting AI and NVDIA

https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters"
2025-10-12,A discount is $50 a share
2025-10-11,Exactly… BUY BUY BUY the dips!
2025-10-11,"I don’t think we’ll ever see $170 NVDA again... sure, the trail zigzags, but the mountain keeps climbing. We’re entering an age where AI and quantum computing feed each other like fission and fusion — and NVIDIA is the core reactor. Their data-center revenue exploded +93% YoY to $35.6 B last quarter, giving them a 92% GPU market share. They’ve spent two decades laying the foundation for this. When quantum breakthroughs arrive and crypto security gets cracked, billions in digital wealth will flow toward real innovation: chips, compute, and infrastructure. NVDA is the trunk of the tree — everything new in tech is a branch growing from it. Twenty years ago, Apple was “the computer company that might end up in your kitchen.” Now it’s in every hand, every home, every pocket. NVIDIA will be the same — powering every product, every service, every industry. You can’t bet against the ecosystem that builds the future."
2025-10-12,"Oh I agree, I completely support the vision and believe there is still big growth ahead. But OP was asking if we’ll see $200 by end of week next week. With the state of the market it’s  just not realistic. But it’s coming for sure…"
2025-10-12,Buy the dip
2025-10-12, Warren Buffet says : buy when everyone panics . We all confident that Nvda has a great future!!!
2025-10-12,Do you think it’s a good time to buy? Is it too early?
2025-10-13,It’s a huge buying opportunity.  Wait till Wed or Thursday.  Get ready for record earnings!
2025-10-11,Buy baby buy
2025-10-11,Trump will hold tight and not bend. We could see 150 again . Tuesday will be a blowout with all the sell orders ready to tank the market. Could we gal down 1000? If we drop more than that some of those guys on margin may start to panic.
2025-10-11,"Reality. China was buying their chips from Taiwan and Singapore. It was \~40% of total Nvidia sales. The sanctions had ZERO effect.

This time China has simply stopped buying Nvidia hardware. China won't sell rare earths  because they have militarily applications."
2025-10-11,Both leaders will spin it as a win for themselves. The money those of us make in buying the dips makes this bullshit easier to deal with....sigh
2025-10-12,"I didn't see the light of green until I was already a man, and by then I was nothing but homeless"
2025-10-11,"You already know the date (Nov1), buy preemptive puts for insurance"
2025-10-12,Undervalued comment... lol. :)
2025-10-11,"Damn, I sold covered calls. All expired worthless. Now I have to sell more covered calls."
2025-10-11,It’s only China? Clearly you have no knowledge of retail. Chinese goods have the most influence in the US. it’s not a real tariff? CHina has all the time in the world. TRump has a few years. How many times have you been to China? I have been there and have done business there. I have been involved in retail sales probably longer than you are alive. Stating it’s only China shows that you really don’t know wheee goods are made .
2025-10-11,"One thing I know for sure never count on the Chinese to crash US market, they’re too chicken and many of their high officials have us investments,  it’s not in their interest to do it"
2025-10-11,"Guidance doesn’t take in consideration China, therefore we are good

Only thing worry here is the minerals topic, but it’s not just an NVIDIA isssue"
2025-10-11,Funny how bad the stock took a hit when China has been off the table for NVDA to begin with
2025-10-12,Buy or sell on Monday?
2025-10-12,This orange man should drop dead already. Making money himself and for his friends thru news and market manipulation
2025-10-12,">This time it's only China.

This time ""it’s only China"" is clueless statement. Bro, supply chains are global, Chinese parts run through Mexico, Vietnam, etc., so this ‘China-only’ tariffs ripple everywhere. Your post reeks of stupidity and ignorance.   
  
And tariffs aren’t cosplay; they’re real costs until rolled back. Markets can shrug short-term, but the price hit bleeds in over months as BOMs renew for products.   
  
NVDA goes up because it builds the best AI hardware/software stack (CUDA + Blackwell) and executes, they've got the datacenter business nailed, you've no idea how big of a deal that is for their business. Yes, they need China and India but calling this as a not a big deal is going to end so badly for everyone."
2025-10-11,Another TACO trade in the works. If this goes down to $155 I am buying more.
2025-10-11,Good for you!
2025-10-12,"Sounds good. I’ll be selling CSPs on Monday. Ok with assignment, also ok with expiring worthless whatever happens next :) 

I don’t currently hold any NVDA but I do have a (NVDA-heavy) tech fund that I DCA’d into in past years when I was still working"
2025-10-11,A country can only be bullied so much before they can't take it anymore.  They don't need us as much as we think they do.  A lot of other countries are getting tired of Trump's antics and bullshit that they don't want to deal with us anymore.
2025-10-11,Thats a good thing. You need those nice entry points.
2025-10-12,I’m hoping for $120 🙏🏼
2025-10-11,"Yeah, Trump thinks he is a bad ass. But he is just a fool. China has him by the balls as they control rare earth minerals. The BRICS have wanted to move away from the dollar for a long time. Things are in play to make China the do I ate power in the world with this wannabe sick dictator in the Whitehouse. And 3 more years of this bullshit."
2025-10-12,Bullied? They've charged premiums on import/export for years gtfoh.
2025-10-14,You’re displaying your ignorance of the market and how geopolitical activity affects the market. You just have to be a Trump supporter. Somehow they misunderstood it as passing out trains. And for your benefit I have been in the market for some 60 years and seen such things happened with politicians of every color. And it is not just politician. Your toads raising the national debt did not go well for him either. But he has done some good things. Got rid of the penny. That was a big help and will reduce our debt. I thought that was a wise move. But raping and grabbing women’s private parts is just not the person I want my children to have in the living room each night. I did not vote for the convict. But this is are system and this is what we have for now.
2025-10-11,"Relax buddy, it’s just an overreaction to the kid fucking 🧃 loving orange man’s big mouth. We will be back"
2025-10-11,Buy the dip.
2025-10-11,If your time frame is long enough eventually $2000 will be the price increase on a bottle of soda compared to the previous year caused by 2% inflation.  Don't count Jensen's 10^12 grandson out just yet.

2025-10-11,The whole market moved not just Nvidia. Macro factors at play.
2025-10-11,because nvda didn’t fall alone orange man moved the whole market so his friends could buy more
2025-10-11,Holding on it will be through the roof in 2 weeks
2025-10-11,Do people not look at the rest of the index or news before wondering why their precious NVDA stock went down that day?
2025-10-11,"While everyone here is screaming 😱mania and run for safety, smart investors are studying chart and getting ready to buy in the next 24-48 hours. VIX spiked 30% in 1 day, possibly peaking in the next day or 2. Every time this happened market surged in the following week/month. 

I’m now getting ready to deploy capital in my SGOV to buy beaten down names when the VIX peaks in the next 24-48 hours. 

Looking at META/MSFT and AVGO/NVDA and a few others. Good luck. Use this sell off as your buying opportunity. Look at the last sell off in April. Did you take advantage of the fear and buy when everyone runs for safety ?"
2025-10-11,"I'm buying more, champ"
2025-10-11,"It dumped???   Hmmm 🤔 

Did you not notice it was at ATH and then dumped.  All by itself.   Everything was up and the market was a +1000 day.

Tangerine Tornado had nothing to do with this.

Uh NVDA bubble mustve popped.  Sell everything you have now 

🤡🤡🤡"
2025-10-11,"I actually enjoy every down dollar.   Shakes out the gamblers who are dicking with options.

I don't have to worry.   In for the long haul since 2019.   All I got is time.


Shake out the paper hands and the gamblers dicking with options."
2025-10-11,"Couple of billion wiped out, nov 1 100% tariff, monday market will open red🙄"
2025-10-11,"I'm pretty happy I didn't have to roll my covered call 😂.. honestly, the pullback is healthy imo..  it can't keep going up forever.. I can see NVDA going back to 150ish easy..but then back to 200 before the end of year lol

Source: trust me bruh"
2025-10-11,Reddit has become filled with new investors flabbergasted after a dumb. It’s just people panicking. Literally to me. Nothing happened I look at my weekly. I’m up 0.2% this week. That’s a nothing week for me.
2025-10-11,"People get so dramatic about a pullback, buy the dips. Nvidia is solid and will hit $200 before years end."
2025-10-12,Buy the dip
2025-10-12,It was good for the market. We were overdue a correction. Should make for a nice Christmas rally.
2025-10-12,"Investors are all useless paperhands, selling in full retarded mode. Next Friday everything will be ok."

2025-10-11,"Shhh.  Don't tell him.   He's gambling is the only reason he's here.

Actual investors with serious 💰 on the line know the whole market took a dive like a lead anchor or concrete shoes because Trump flatulated about more tariff porn.

I hate when people come on here the whole market dives because of something Trump farted out and someone asks ""well gee golly NVDA bubble is popping."""
2025-10-11,Macro factors? Maybe Macaroni Head factors. Wonder how much tRumps cronies made on their puts.

2025-10-11,this!!! we work hard and do our due diligence and then one man comes open his dumb mouth and manipulates the market. if u want proof look at the short volumes of as many stocks as u want few minutes before he announced it. his people def knew
2025-10-11,"Well, did you buy more????"
2025-10-11,"Stop telling them this.   He thinks NVDA is crashing.  Let's feed this rumor since they obviously don't have access to TV or radio news..

""NVDA bubble has popped. Sell now!"""
2025-10-11,"Honestly this is why I got truth social and follow trump. The only reason. I need any advantage I can get and it honestly saved me tens of thousands and earned me tens of thousands getting notifications early. It’ll happen for 3 more years, so just follow and reap the rewards. So predictable how his tweets move markets. And yes. Agree he is a dumb f*ck."
2025-10-11,"How is he fucking you over? Unless you need the money tomorrow, which if you do you shouldn't be investing, he hasn't done anything other than give you an opportunity to buy at a lower price than yesterday. And hopefully Monday we can buy at a lower price than today. 
And let's be real anything over 5% a year is better than what any bank will give you. So unlike you, I call these tariff announcements a gift wrapped opportunity. 
be thankful."
2025-10-11,Exactly. Just hold on. We need a dip to go next leg up. Does everyone think stocks is one straight line up? Buy the dips and bigger dips and you will do just fine.
2025-10-11,"Thank God finally someone that sees this as the laziest of posts.  

You have to be on an island with zero access to Internet or news to not see the whole market crashed and why.   Which then begs the question how he found out NVDA crashed and burned


Keep him on his toes as punishment tell him NVDA bubble popped.  Sell! Sell! Sell!"
2025-10-11,"I agree with you, people panicking causes a over reaction and created a free for all downfall.
Good news is we have a weekend so those that sold can reflect on their actions. and they will reenter the Market at a reduced price."

2025-10-11,Don't bother posting to lazy posters that only lookup NVDA stock and refuse to notice the sea of red all around.   These are gamblers with only access to a NVDA slot machine.

what do you think are we heading there?"
2025-10-12,"i had some covered calls, looks like they calls i shorted will expire worthless and i get free money.

im in this for the long term"
2025-10-11,I actually have wondered this.   Like without my tin foil hat on.   This happens out of the blue and for no reason all of the time everything is going along... Trump doesnt get the Nobel Peace prize so he reaches for the financial market nuclear football.
2025-10-11,So buy more? Its not like you lost money if you are holding.
2025-10-11,Because you and your cronies got scared and sold?  Just curious lol
2025-10-11,Trump's cronies selling at 195 on inside info and buying back at 180 is not fear.
2025-10-11,"That is the way. Sell low, buy high."
2025-10-11,Years ago I was told by an insider  trader is that you tell 3-6 casual acquaintances  who don't know each other to spread the news.
2025-10-11,"Oh make no mistake it's not that simple.... 

He tells one person ... That person is removed 7 ways from Sunday from anyone making transactions.

Publicly accessible webpage on Ferret Feeding habits.... Hidden html code that when that .html page gets edited - the cronies get a page on your phones.... BUY ALL NOW or SELL SHORT !! FIRE SALE!!! 🔥🔥

He ain't stupid after the ringer he's been put thru with his last go round.   He ain't touching no one or calling no one.   No smoke signals nothing.   It could be as simple as whispering sweet nothings to Melania and she goes and whispers into person x ... 

There ain't no breadcrumbs now."
2025-10-12,This is a stupid thought process.  Trump had to respond to China’s BS.  How is Trump’s buddies going to make money when they are losing the day just like everyone else?  They certainly aren’t going to sell out of the market just to short it for a day

2025-10-12,tell me you’re dumb without telling me you’re dumb. as said by the other dude. there’s crazy put /short volume of every stock just 10 mins before trump announced it. so they made billions on everything going down and more if using margin and they’ll make even more going up like everyone else
2025-10-11,https://www.ainvest.com/news/wtf-option-bets-surge-trump-tweet-2504/
2025-10-11,some people didn't learn from April.  Dips are good. Especially if you've been hoarding cash looking for a buying opportunity.
2025-10-12,Go ahead. Buy the dip. But what qualifies as a dip? S&P down 2.5%? 7%? Over what timeframe? What if you’re talking about a stock? The Beta on that stock will inform how relevant the “dip” in question is. A high Beta stock experiences dips of 3% regularly whereas a low Beta stock does not. Have a set of metric that you stick to and be patient.
2025-10-11,One stock i never hold! This + pltr

2025-10-11,I’m holding for now I think I’ll look at buying more if it hits $160’s
2025-10-12,I think Monday could be a good buying opportunity
2025-10-17,When the dips are fear based Ill buy every time. Its almost as bad as April fears and the market hasn't even declined much.
2025-10-11,"""I just bought four more shares"" 🤣"
2025-10-11,Sell high buy low. Make more money.
2025-10-15,Fucking PLTR is trading 504x/earnings. Shit is a trap now. I bought at IPO and sold 1500%. But yea shit is way OV now.
2025-10-11,I do and I did. Will buy more next week if the opportunity presents itself. 6 months from now we’ll be at $225+

2025-10-11,"Tarriffs! Nvda is one stick that has kept my portfolio alive along with a few others. I took advantage of the sale and bought stocks that were 300

2025-10-11,Why the dip?  It’s because of the Dip in the Oval Office…..who is probably buying the dip right now through his two proxy Dips.
2025-10-10,"Trumps back
He wants his friends to buy the dip"
2025-10-10,Will it go up again shortly?
2025-10-10,Listen to the news… read about market fluctuations and the economy.

2025-10-11,"Buy the dip! 

LMFAO"
2025-10-11,I figured something would happen over the three day weekend (it always does) did not expect it to come crashing today
2025-10-11,"junk bonds. Nobody knows whats out there, they didn't see tricolor blow-up and JEF had no clue a billion in accounts receivable loans was bad. They were blindsided by the chapter 7. Banks are going to Fed window and reverse repo is probably tapped in next couple days.

2025-10-11,Old but new news: China custom hates nvidia cards
2025-10-11,Buy the dip
2025-10-11,a dip of $3 is something you are concerned about? tsla moves $10-40 or so in a day. most growth swings 10-25% during the course of a year and then recovers... Just saying.
2025-10-11,"Trumps tariffs impacted the market heavily today, all of the index’s including the S&P where down 2-3% after his announcement, almost all sectors besides raw materials where impacted"
2025-10-11,So you can buy
2025-10-11,Look into the Swedish stockmarket. I can give you a tip. Saab and freemelt is the one right now. Even norways stockmarket is good for example Kongsberg
2025-10-11,I’m no genius. But it would make sense to drop large amount of $$$ on the stock Monday. It it dropped $13 bucks a share. Wouldn’t that mean it will hit that again in the short period????
2025-10-11,"Trump “truthed” creating a chance for profit taking. I added to my positions, but by only 10-15%."

2025-10-11,Time to buy more
2025-10-11,BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY
2025-10-11,It’s not WHY…. The dip…. It’s BUY BUY BUY the dip!!!!! Asap!!!
2025-10-11,"Stock well overvalued, due for a huge dip, will hit really hard on Monday. The institutional investors always win on their trades so dont expect them to have the same faith and holding value as retail. They just rake in what they can and move on to the next trade leaving retailers in the dust. Their sensitivity to fundamentals and volatility mean they dont over play speculative hyper valuations. If they can get their gains theyre good to go since they don't need a single trade to make their billions. Beware of the rugpull potentially coming this Monday. Dont be greedy. Learn to win and live to play another day."
2025-10-11,Plus it’s a buying opportunity!!

2025-10-11,"I lost something like 20k yesterday. Why? Cause trump announced 100% tariffs on china cause he’s an idiot who does this. I have 8k sitting in cash I’ll put them into some stocks that dropped and are solid companies like google and Amazon and watch them spike and keep playing this game he’s playing. Problem is some people won’t make it through this. The elderly, who depend on their 401ks, farmers who aren’t selling their soy beans to china, among others"
2025-10-11,"Trump caused it by announcing tariffs he wanted to tank the market after warning some select people so they could buy low and make some money when he does a 180.

2025-10-10,You win $100 obviously
2025-10-11,"He did. Trump bailed out Argentina, who then lowered their soy bean prices so China stopped buying from US farmers. They also added some port fees on all US ships and launched an antitrust case on Qualcomm, so angry Cheeto is pissed and shouting threats."

2025-10-11,Sell your stocks and move to china
2025-10-10,Trump started this Bullshit in March. So yeah. It's all on him.
2025-10-10,"Trump ignited massive trade war with China, slapping tariffs on the entire planet and hitting China hardest. China then starts positioning itself to use rare earth metal exports as a weapon in this newly ignited trade war. Trump went on a trade war with China in his first term. 

It’s almost like, anybody could’ve seen that electing someone who’s economic policy is to usurp the power to tax from Congress to levy insane taxes on imports, and piss off our trade partners with limited worldview distributive bargaining would have these types of expected results. 

You:  “this is all chinas fault”

China is at best a frenemy but I don’t recall them pulling the rug out from under us with rare earths until we acted in bad faith, **making up numbers based on trade deficits that benefit us financially** to institute “reciprocal” tariffs"
2025-10-11,Definitely buying at leSt 6 mos out
2025-10-10,Stocks were at ATH but no credit to Trump. They dip “Orange man bad” 😂😂😂you people
2025-10-11,Makes me feel good.
2025-10-11,"I agree but dude, it’s an easy $10k here and there. Saved my ass so many times. Just take advantage of it. No brainer imo."
2025-10-11,Nah. I've still got $200k cash. Waiitng for him to Taco out again.
2025-10-11,"""You: “this is all chinas fault”"" - **This is a lie and misrepresentation  what I said.** 

Do you actually believe that China, who wants to own AI and all of the minerals that are needed to create the next wave of technology, and war machines, would play nice trading with us? Give us everything we need to fight them in a war and compete in AI? Have you not learned anything from them over the past 50 years? If you believe that you're not only lying about things I've said, you're lying to yourself.

And we have these resources, but to get them it's very environmentally difficult. It is in China too, but they don't have the EPA or let the voices of thousands of environmentalists sway their objective. Maybe if we didn't either we would want/need to buy them from China and instead of mine them ourselves."
2025-10-11,USAR warrants have been printing money for me. I’m still up 18k on AMD. Up 23k on SOXL. I’ve had OKLO since last October. It turns into longterm gains this weekend. Life is good.
2025-10-11,"So going up has nothing to do with him but every time it goes down it’s his fault.

Good to know you are cognitively dissonant from reality"
2025-10-11,"I believe that had the US government not initiated trade regulations limiting NVDA from selling gpu’s above a certain performance ratio 5 years ago, and had we not begun a backwards ass economic policy threatening **every country on the planet** with economic disparity unless they come kiss the ring, 

China would 

a) still be buying NVDA gpu’s en masse

b) not be leveraging rare earths (a major bargaining chip for them) against us right now 

Why are they all about self reliance and domestic production for gpu’s? We cut them off 5 years ago, giving them gimped/cut down versions of the products. This drives a desire for cutting off reliance on the west, it doesn’t foster a demand for the products. 

In the same way we’re about to be all about self reliance/domestic production for rare earths: our main supplier is giving us problems.

Wanna drive a country to self reliance in any market sector? Cut off access to foreign supply, watch it happen."
2025-10-11,Me too. Still have plenty of shares but watching others climb while Nvidia sits is making feel like I'm losing out.
2025-10-11,"I'm bummed, I just missed the AMD run up. Was going to buy Monday morning when premarket opened
It shot up immediately.
NVTS was going the same direction, until that cunt Trump opened his ignorant mouth. Oh well. I'm still up $20k from $189k from October 1st."
2025-10-11,"It means selling the stock, but it sells only when it drops below a certain percentage, from the highest point. So let's say a, stock is at $10. And it's increasing on price. You can put an order in to sell it, if it drops more than 2 of the highest point.

So, let's say the price loves to $10.50. Now, the sell point would be if it drops 2% below $10.50

So as the price live up. So does the sell point."
2025-10-10,"China is not an ally, not even a good trading partner. They are and act like an enemy more often than not. Why would you expect any president not to deal with them as such? Why haven't so many presidents over the past 50 years treated them as they've earned to be treated? 

I don't love this either. But myopically blaming Trump because people are just anti-Trump is an ignorant and unrealistic take on the entire relationship. And it certainly doesn't help people who come to learn about NVDA stock and it's outlook. Claiming this all started in March is revisionist history, and for some reason people constantly revise it against the US."
2025-10-10,"Still not living in reality. 

Why do you TDS Orange Man Bad nuts focus so much attention on T's man parts? It's really odd. But maybe not so odd."
2025-10-10,"It's a rip off if they require your IP to do business there then take it and create competing products and sell them for a lower price all over the world, including in the US. 

What would you give as an example of a rip off?"
2025-10-11,"I kinda want nvda to settle a bit, make it easier to sell covered calls lol. Ive been burned once or twice this year"
2025-10-11,"Based on the last artificial recession that he initiated, you should be good to go by next week. The market seems to shake him off after the first one. I just so happened to buy another chunk of AMD the day before it went up. I woke up to something around $238 per share. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It went down by end of day but it was now over 40 from what I bought it at. I was buying SOXL today at what I thought would be “the dip”. Some at 39, then at 37, then 36. I stopped and just stared at my new 150 shares going down in value. I saw it go to something around 31.60 and almost bought more. Common sense kicked in and said, “It may be cheaper next week.” SOXL was 7.33 I believe on April 7th. It went near 6X from April 7th. If that occurs again, have your dry powder ready. All the best."
2025-10-11,Thank you. I appreciate the info. I’m assuming I can do something similar with a buy? I see lots of options (limits?) but haven’t understood it enough.
2025-10-11,That means nothing when you are clearly the ones in denial of reality. The mental gymnastics are incredible
2025-10-11,"I’m not anti Trump blindly. I’m against a lot of his policies- some are good but most are very damaging (Canada 51st state- Really?). Before being all attacking, which the MAGA base very much does, you need to foster conversation. Fiery rhetoric just makes you look like an asshole. 

Here’s the thing- businesses went to China for a reason. The top 0.01% made these calls. Trump’s own red hats were all made in China. Until Trump penalizes those directly who make these decisions, manufacturing will never come back. 

Tariffs are a tax on people in a world where cost of living and income growth are wildly disproportionate. There are other ways to foster bringing back manufacturing, but it can’t be this way."
2025-10-11,"Dude, before posting on Reddit, try using your brain to think, instead of just shitposting based on your tribal affiliation. You’re getting downvoted because people are sick of this shit. "

Also, Rare Earths weren't as important then as they are today. China didn't have this leverage then. Different times my friend, different measures."
2025-10-11,"One of you arguing with me, for simply stating that China did something Trump is responding/ reacting to (what is bering reported in CNBC and others), **told me to get Trump's cock out of my mouth.** Spare me the lecture on fostering conversation and civil discourse.  One of you TDS anti-Trumpers, no not you, attacked me first. 

""Fiery rhetoric""... good grief."
2025-10-11,LOL. Stupid and sad all in one short post.
2025-10-11,"So you're saying the terms were that China would use our IP to create competing products, undercut the price (as there was little R&D) and sell it in the US, competing with the very firms that were forced to hand over the IP? That was the deal? You're saying we agreed to that, even if those terms were not stated, because we didn't walk away. OK. Not a rip off at all."
2025-10-11,"That’s ironic considering it’s exactly what you are doing. Meanwhile I’m stating objective facts and calling out your clear hypocrisy. Typical projection. 

And oh wow, Reddit, the biggest leftist echo chamber on the internet, is downvoting something that is even the slightest bit Trump-positive…? What a surprise! 

Keep proving how brainwashed you are"
2025-10-11,"In clear English, I'm saying that any firm that gave China their IP did so knowingly and because they thought it was a benefit to themselves as a business. The past 30 years have proven how profitable this was for American companies, and how much of a boost in 'quality of life' for regular Americans who could suddenly afford a lot more stuff. And how great it was for continuing to fuel our economy which is almost 100% based on consumer spending. 

And I'm also saying, knowingly, this could not have happened had Clinton not been so eager to get even wealthier beyond imagination by changing China's position in trade with the US to something that basically means preferred partner.

There's no black and white here. It's bullshit but it's great but then it's bad but there's also good."
2025-10-11,"any firm that gave China their IP did so knowingly and because they thought it was a benefit to themselves as a business. - I agree.

Then China took that IP and used it against us. That is not a good faith trading partner. They haven't been for decades. Why people think they suddenly would be, especially as they get ever closer to us in influence on the global stage and militarily, is beyond me. 

Rare earths are a huge boon for them, internally and for trading, and using it as leverage against trading partners. I expect them to continue to be hostile trading partners going forward... and Trump could be a weak Clintonite (as you point out) dealing with them, or he could trade on a go forward basis with their aggressive and difficult trading past fully in consideration. IMO, acting like Clinton is the way to make things feel better short term, but way worse for us long term."

Data centres require huge amounts of power. The IAI predicts data centres will use ~1000 TWh in 2030. Roughly equivalent to the annual energy usage of Japan or 100 nuclear reactors. Power generation is a key hurdle for AI scaling."

2025-10-10,"Not at all the same. Even if you want to draw any similarities let's remember that ""Tulipmania"" happened in the 1600s in Amsterdam. That ""bubble"" if you will, lead to the Netherlands becoming the largest exporter of flowers, including tulips, across the world, year after year for the last 400 years and is now considered the ""Flower capital of the world"". It's now a $4-6 Billion dollar annual industry, so hardly a bubble or dead industry in the long run. 

There will be small AI players that go belly up or get eaten up being bought out by the bigger fish. Nvidia is the Apex predator though in the field of AI. Even with volatility as AI infrastructure gets established Nvidia will remain. If the whole market crumbles on a dramatic reset, Nvidia will be the one that rises from the ashes. Bet against them and you'll regret it"
2025-10-10,"Cost of GPUs normalize? LMAO

Nvidia invented GPUs, there is literally no competition in sight, and they have completely revolutionized the computer industry

Analyst estimate that for every dollar spent on Nvidia GPUs, cloud providers can generate $5-7 in revenue over a four year period

That is why EVERY major tech company is spending as much money as possible on Nvidia GPUs and they are continuing to raise Capex guidance 

No one is buying outdated CPU technology to build their data centers

Oracle has a $455 billion cloud compute revenue backlog. They will use NVIDIA GPUs to meet this demand

The TCO for Nvidia GPUs is so superior to their competition that even if the competition's chips were free, Nvidia would still have a lower TCO

Nvidia is the only company in the world that can build $50+ billion AI data centers

Everyone is switching to accelerated computing with Nvidia

They will be spending the next 10+ years modernizing the tech infrastructure of the entire planet

This will lead to hundreds to new multi-billion dollar artificial intelligence companies

Nvidia is supplying the compute capacity for ALL of these AI startups and investing in the best ones

You are trying to cope with the fact that you don't own any shares as Nvidia closes at an all time high

Thank you for your attention to this matter"

2025-10-10,"No interest in it really, if they operated more like the energy or mining sector paying out what they can I'd be all about it.  I just don't see how shareholders will recoup value especially when the CEO decided he's a hedge fund manager."
2025-10-10,"Thank you for the info that's pretty neat.

I think what you said is parallel here.  It's not that the industry will disappear just there will be a reset in prices which translates to margins for Nvidia and for the companies who paid the higher margins it translates to a reduction in the value of their assets.  The getting is really good right now but for the price people are paying, the earnings haven't been retained to justify it and ultimately they are completely dependent on capital appreciation which will disappear with the margins."
2025-10-10,"Margins so high are destructive bro.  To the economy and the businesses as well.  Like a rock at the top of a hill, nature is going to bring that beast down.

And let's think about this.  If AI is successful, that means it will be margin destructive.  Sure at first hypothetically Oracle gets a bit of an edge on Epic in the medical database field if they adopt first but AI will bring the same advantages to Epic and it will be a race to the lowest margins without monopoly/collusion type arrangements.  Ultimately it becomes about access to capital because knowledge will be equal along with margins etc"
2025-10-10,"Hey, they could be holding 0.05 shares!"
2025-10-10,I see the external investments as a plus for more than their ability to enhance systems sales. They indirectly are letting little retail investor me have an interest in these companies (think Open AI) that are choosing to fund themselves through private equity rather than through public offerings. I dislike the de-democratization of the market that this trend towards private equity causes - the rich keep getting richer - but I have a bit of back door access by owning NVIDIA. I would also note that you don’t have to return shareholder value through dividends or distributions. You create  a lot of value by cranking the share price higher and higher. Berkshire paid a dividend once and has certainly created shareholder value.
2025-10-10,"I understand what you're worried about, but I think you're underestimating what's incoming. Specialized generative AI and agents will be the next revenue source. The valuation is justified because the revenue will come in my opinion and come in big. NVDA is sitting on a ton of cash reserves as well to float them through laying the ground work. Nvidia is going with the strategy of ""If you build it, they will come"" 
We'll see. I've been in this since back at $0.48 and have gone through so many bear cycles where people said valuation wasn't justified only to see it go higher, much higher. I think going forward it will be more the same because this is what they've been waiting for and now it's just getting started. What comes next will be world changing"
2025-10-10,I can dig it but I'll just say I think Lip-Bu Tan at Intel has a better path looking for acquisitions and I feel like Jensen investing in his customers is similar to making a retirement fund of equity from your job.  But if owning a bit of Open AI is something you see as a plus then more power to ya 👍
2025-10-10,Congrats on the big win 👍 like you say we'll see.  With the circular nature and concentration of wealth and income within this group it is kind of it's own monster maybe it can break the laws of nature.
2025-10-10,"Margins are synonymous with poverty.  With the same economic activity in dollar terms, comparing 10% margins and 60% margins while holding upstream and downstream margins the same, the difference is paychecks for like 200M people idk my math might be off there."
2025-10-10,"Extremely!  But just want to be clear I'm being honest with my take, I believe investing is difficult enough without the addition of dishonest takes!

Poverty is the driver for reducing margins so it's not a surprise they cycle the other way I guess."
2025-10-10,"Thanks for the insight Socrates

You seem to be missing the entire artificial intelligence revolution point

Good luck with the poverty situation"
2025-10-10,"Lol.

If AI is successful in how it's portrayed the economy goes to zero or infinite.

The idea that AI is margin accreditive must ignore competitors also having AI.  Or it relies on monopoly like practices between competitors."
2025-10-10,"Economy either goes to zero or infinity, eh?

You're too dumb to argue with

Good luck at Wendys"
2025-10-09,Give us your next prediction then 
2025-10-10,Let’s goooooo $300 by end of next year
2025-10-09,"Ok but there’s no way it will go over $200, anyone who believes that is a fool! And I’m laughing at you! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
2025-10-10,"Big Effing deal. 
I've made 10% since October 1st, daytrading several stocks, including NVDA. NVDA has only gone up 3% in the same time period.

Everybody has been screaming ""we're seeing $200 by the end of the month."" That's only 5% from today."
2025-10-10, They even said it would go sub $80….
2025-10-10,"If you were successfully making 100% stock predictions for 15 years, you certainly wouldn't be wasting your time writing silly posts here."
2025-10-10,"My friends laughed at me when I said $200 in 2025 and when I raised my position in Nvidia to 50% of my portfolio when it dropped to $86 in April. They aren’t laughing now, but I am😂🚀"
2025-10-10,"Is this the same guy that keeps posting this garbage? I swear I've seen like 10 of these same title posts with a different price target. Sometimes I like to think Nvidia investors are more mature and level headed, and then I see this 14 year old behavior and rethink staying in this sub"
2025-10-10,$200 end of year ...
2025-10-10,Hope to hit $200 tomorrow lol
2025-10-10,"u/realslizzard u/dmndhnds2mn u/evilbeyken Can we ban OP, his posts degrade the quality of the subreddit"
2025-10-10,"It’s at $195 today, you sure you’re sticking to that theory?😂😂😂 it will hit $200"
2025-10-10,We will pretty much see 240. This is the final euphoria you are going to see in the market. I am not saying its fair value in terms of market cap for nvda. But bull markets can surprise you. Wait and see.
2025-10-09,Agreed! Nvidia is totally more likely to go to $100 before $200. $199.99 is forever resistance. Good luck investing in a companies imminent demise you fools!
2025-10-10,"They made fun of me and said ""Bruh it's going to $100 before $190 bruh!!""  Ahahhahhahha they were WRONG once again!"
2025-10-10,"October 23,2025. We cross $200. Heard it here first folks."
2025-10-10,You think just because it’s hit $200 multiple times in the past before splits it will do it again? I mock you all.
2025-10-10,"I’m just messing with this poster because he makes this post every time the stock hits a milestone and says everyone was laughing at him but he knew it would hit it all along, so I just decided to become the nonexistent “they”"
2025-10-10,"Bruh, now you are just a lying sack of shit… The stock hasn’t been trading in the $100’s or briefly in the upper 80’s for 5 years until it split 10-1 last year. 

Nice try dipshit and try following the stock longer than 2 months, if that…"
2025-10-10,"It’s less than $7 away from $200, pretty sure it will hit $200 soon."
2025-10-10,Waaaaaa it was $100 may 2025... take a look at a stock chart
2025-10-10,"Individually no, but collectively we can lol. Reddit brought GME out from the dead so anything's possible."
2025-10-10,$10T by 2030
2025-10-16,"Maybe $190 a share by January, depending on Trump"
2025-10-16,"$10T by 2030 would be wild, that’d put Nvidia in true “mega-cap legend” territory."
2025-10-10,$200 in 2025!
2025-10-09,"My opinion $180 is a good buy price $185 Tops,  after that it is considered high in my opinion. I bought at $169.59 Cost 👍 Will be Holding for many years now , Also Bullish for Nvidia in the Long Term"
2025-10-09,Yes. 100% people are buying. It’s the only thing that makes a stock go up. Else it would be selling and it would be going down.
2025-10-09,I buy every week regardless of price.
2025-10-09,"the bubble has a form,but probably the price is going up as the noise increases"
2025-10-09,NVDA has a long way to go. I bought last week and would buy more today if I had the $$
2025-10-09,I bought in at ATH $126
2025-10-09,"I bought at 21$ then later at 134.

The answer depends on your holding period. If you are ready to hold and are prepared to have some potential loss at first, why not ! Hold it for 5 years or longer, buying now would not be crazy if you believe in the stock potential growth."
2025-10-09,I'm still buying small amounts daily!
2025-10-10,I buy monthly. Usually when the monthly doom fake news comes out and all the idiots sell. The more red the numbers for the day the more likely I'll put in my monthly buy.
2025-10-09,"They'll be willing bag holders if they plan to hold too long. A $200 target seems likely, and may tap above that around 205-210 but the market needs a rest. We're entering a period ahead where it's a perfect time for that, and after selling it's a set up for a rally into the holidays. 

Though it's quality name with plenty of growth ahead and tons of cash it can still correct along with the rest of overvalued stocks and lose 10-20%+ very fast. Corrections are healthy and how markets can continue higher."
2025-10-09,"Today’s volume is 82.8 million shares as I type this. It’s up over $5. Of course people are buying it. Good grief.

Now, if your’re asking if YOU should buy it? Who knows? I can’t tell you that, no one can."
2025-10-09,"I bought today at ATHs. I’ve learned that this stock always goes up (eventually). Some times it goes through periods of consolidation but the demand eventually causes it to go up. Keep in mind 2026 hasn’t begun and it’s likely at some point in the future Jensen maybe be allowed to sell into China. Now if only Leftnut can keep his fat mouth shut…When/If that happens the stock will skyrocket up and you don’t want to be out when that happens. I’m looking 5 years down the line before I exit so I fully expect another split within the next 3-5 years. The global demand, not just the hyperscalers, and the demand created by data centers will continue to push up this stock. Don’t be short sighted. Stay invested and if you take profits be sure you get back in before the train leaves the station."
2025-10-09,"I sold at $150……now just bought back in and set up recurring automatic weekly buys.

Learn from me….don’t sell"
2025-10-10,That’s not a good gut. Ai is just getting started.
2025-10-10,Yeah bought some today… just trying to continue accumulating more shares
2025-10-10,"$180 ain't bad, but at this point you're gonna have to be willing to set aside that money for 5+ years if you wanna see some meaningful profits."
2025-10-10,Find a red day and throw your money in it
2025-10-10,Buying every dip!
2025-10-10,"Think about it this way, if you are thinking for long term investment, Nvda, is a great stock to buy at high low mid because it’s the future, think of what $1000 now can be in 2030 if you buy now and leave there"
2025-10-09,"Stock is already 10 points beyond its breakout. The safe time to buy the break to new highs has passed.

Does not mean that it won't keep going higher, but you'd be chasing here."
2025-10-09,Good for you
2025-10-09,I own some NVDA. But these analyst are dumb. They raise price targets as stocks go up. And drop price targets as prices go down. Any monkey can do that.
2025-10-10,"Their “analysis” basically says: price go up → target go up， price go down → target go down.  
Brilliant insight ， truly irreplaceable."
2025-10-10,"No one is lowering price targets on Nvidia

It will easily hit $300 a share in a year or two

Do some research"
2025-10-10,"That’s your reply? Didn’t really read the comment I guess. The stock is going up (higher numbers) so analysts just keep raising their target prices (also higher numbers). What’s being suggested is that if the stock were to start a downtrend (lower numbers), then analyst would simply follow and drop their target prices (also lower numbers)."

2025-10-09,"So in other words, all money earned by all Germany in an entire year still isnt enough to buyout NVIDIA outright.

Crazy"
2025-10-09,"That's good. Most people don't know German or invest in Germany stocks. Big doesn't mean bad, just means they have more capital to deploy to do more impactful things"
2025-10-10,The comparison should be between nvidia’s revenue and gdp

This allows me to leave my 401k alone and let it grow a for 20 more years for my kids, except for Mandatory withdrawal’s starting at 72, which I can just invest. However, it may hit that (IMHO likely will, within 5 yrs), and if the business is tactical and continues to invest in winning verticals, it could hit $300-$500 in 5-8yrs… once it hits $200 which may be soon, we will see two hits, one will be long/short term investors reaping profits, the other will be institutional pullback for a rinse and repeat, so I expect a hefty 10-15% pullback before it stabilizes and rises again to test next highs. Smart choice, for me, would be to leave it alone until I need it or it aligns with my plans.. in a perfect world, it will repeat its 2021-2024 run that I missed, instead loosing $150k in Biotech (cancer treatments, covid, etc), if it does half of it’s original rise of 1000%, or 500%), Ill be perfectly happy, heck even 250%, I see no reason it cant.."

2025-10-09,Im not selling in two weeks so idgaf
2025-10-09,is amd selling to uae?
2025-10-10,"Big Effing deal. 
I've made 10% since October 1st, daytrading several stocks, including NVDA. NVDA has only gone up 3% in the same time period.

Everybody has been screaming ""we're seeing $200 by the end of the month."" That's only 5% from today."

2025-10-10,"Deep ITM leaps are poor man’s version of owning the stock. It’s cheaper but can be used for selling covered calls and aren’t as susceptible to short term volatility, like you said theta decay."
2025-10-10,Neither. Quite the opposite. Been buying and holding since 2018.
2025-10-09,Everyday is a buy day in NVDA Land.
2025-10-09,Buy something. Then buy more later in a drop. Good for people who believe in a company!
2025-10-09,There will never be a sign that NOW is the time.  It’s a great company.  Buy and hold for the long term and you will be rewarded
2025-10-09,"Bro, any day is a good day as it all depends how much you value it. 

Buy on red days when the stock price dips down, and make it a habit to keep buying on such dips. 

This strategy helps accumulate shares at lower prices over time. Don't panic if the stock drops after buying, as volatility is normal in fast-growing tech stocks like Nvidia. 

Starting small, buying on price dips, and holding for the long term aligns well with successful investing habits in growth stocks."
2025-10-09,"Ask another sub or invest in a different industry, this is a nvda circlejerk sub and people are gonna say yes, they're also emotionally connected to this asset which is something you should never be. No one can tell when ai will, and it will, collapse in on itself and crater the entire tech industry absent of an insane breakthrough."
2025-10-09,"NVDA shows strength for a long while yet. Personally, I might wait for a down day to buy, but it's not going back far really. So, if I had a grand, I wouldn't buy something else. Wait until you are ready to buy and pulled the trigger on NVDA. 

P.S. Everyone wishes they bought this earlier. 😂😂😂"
2025-10-09,I just bought 20 shares of NVDA first timer too
2025-10-09,But and Hold.
2025-10-11,"Welcome! Nvidia’s solid, but timing the exact day is tough. With £1k, think long-term rather than trying to catch the perfect dip."

2025-10-09,"Yes I just bought like a grand. If I see it dropping will put more. I am thinking to buy some more diff stocks.
What you suggest? Many people saying apple or Berkshire Hathaway. 
Or Amazon?"
2025-10-09,"Thank you so much brother I really appreciate it.
Yes I have just invested some money there

Will keep an eye out and if I see price drops then will buy some more.

I am not keeping all my eggs on one basket !
I bought few other random ones too, and also amazon"
2025-10-09,"So for now, what shall I buy alternative?

It’s my first ever purchase, I want to start asap cause I feel like I wasted a lot of money putting my money in saving accounts for peanuts."
2025-10-09," I mean I don’t mind waiting. But imagine next weak I come and see it hit up £200 lol
Then I will regret for not buying it today lol

I personally don’t see it will collapse significantly 

May be £5-10 will get lower

What you think?"
2025-10-09,"Wow congrats and hi5 
Lets hope for the best.

Are you buying any other stocks?

2025-10-09,"Buy a few shares every month as your budget allows.  You don't have go whole-hog all at once. DCA ...cost average your purchases across time.  Also look at some stocks that are involved specifically in supporting the AI infrastructure, for example cooling systems etc.  For instance, VRT is one example.  Also do some research on rare earth mining/metals.  Do thoughtful research, don't just jump in willy nilly."
2025-10-09,"I'm an amateur with these things but my advice is if you're new to trading park your money in an index fund and paper trade online to get a feel for things. The AI industry right now is all speculation and expectations, if those are shaken enough or the hype dies it will be brutal. 

NVDA is propped up by the idea it WILL do xyz and not exactly what it's doing now, it has sustained insane growth priced in which is why the stock tends to fall even with earnings beat, people expect it to forever be an insane growth stock and vastly exceed expectations. IMO I've had my money in NVDA for 2 years and I personally believe ai hype is reaching a peak, but I'm ready to be proved wrong."
2025-10-09,"Maybe. If you are buying long term, it doesn't matter as much when. Better buy before it goes over 200 either way."
2025-10-09,"I just bought like a grand worth of stocks.
Where else I should invest more for potential gain?"
2025-10-09,"Shall I just buy £800 worth of share right now anyway?

I stopped smoking for three months so this is what I saved from smoking"
2025-10-09,"You're not going to get what you're looking for from here. First of all, you shouldn't trust any of us - strangers on the internet. Secondly, you really need to take your time and do some research, focused on your own appetite for risk, and how long you plan to invest.

There's 'potential gain' all over the place, but you shouldn't base your decisions on anything you see here.

I'll tell you what I've done personally, as a 33 year old with essentially fuck all knowledge of experience. I started investing about 18 months / two years ago.

Over time, I got to this position -

About 13K GBP invested in VWRP.

It's just a huge collection of different stocks called an ETF fund. They're a little 'safer' in the sense that they're made up of hundreds, or thousands, of companies, so less volatile, and they are updated every 6 months, so the fund creators will drop and pick up stocks they believe will do well. Mine is about 60% US and 40% global which I liked.

It's been a good year, and it increased about 18%, but I came in hoping for a long term average of 10% a year. Banks would give me 4/5% so i hoped just to double that.

Obviously, it compounds over time, so over 20 years, a small difference of 5% to 10% leads to a HUGE increase in profit. This is my dream.

About 1.5K in NVIDIA. This is now about 2.5K because I luckily bought a lot when Trump panicked everybody. But again, I bought it because it's the big boy in AI, and I believe AI will play a key role in the next century. So, happy to hold long term in the industry leader. Well aware that it can drop the fuck down any time, but hoping for 10% average profit per year.

Finally, about 1.5K in IITU, which is now at about 2K. IITU is a tech ETF, made up about 60% of NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft and Broadcom. So, similar reasons to NVIDIA in terms of wanting tech to be a big part of my investment, just a little more spread.

I've turned 13K into over 15K in a year or so as I said, which I see to be a brilliant year. But, where my real success will come, is that, up or down, I will simply leave this money in for 20 years or more. I feel assured of success over the long term. Btw, I've only invested what I can afford to lose, and you should do the same.

I've trusted that in time, I'll far outdo interest from banks.

If you buy the right stock at the right time you can double your money over night. I prefer to mostly have it in an established world etf fund, offering (I hope), steady, reasonable inclines over time."
2025-10-09,"Thank you so much for taking the time and share your experience. Appreciate it.
I am just buying some mid and high risk stocks which will hurt me a little if I lose it but won’t kill me. I guess you gotta risk it anyway.
I just started my journey, thank to you and all others for their contributions 🫶🏼"
2025-10-11,Good advice
2025-10-09,"Bro, much respect for the attentive response. But no need to discount the advice of the investors here. Some of the best advice I've gotten on the market is from here.  not going to tout numbers but just think 3x minimum returns average. I was raised in this industry and see your minds in the right place. Stating you'll outpace a savings account is not an accolade though. It's expected."
2025-10-09,"All good mate. I might not have formulated my point clearly. I use this sub every day, and guage opinions and learn from them - what I intended to do is ensure that OP (Who was asking what to invest in) didn't take what a stranger on the Internet said as gospel. Far more advice given on these forums from people who haven't a clue what they're doing. I'm glad that the good advice worked for you!


As far as out pacing a savings account not being an accolade..that's one way to put it. I was just being honest about how I went about beginning my investment journey. It's a target I set out with when I knew even less than now! I was sharing my experience rather than advice. 10% a year for me was my original ambition, I obviously hope for more. Its just how I decided to go for it, with the feeling that if I consistently made that bench mark it was a great long term investment.

If I beat it, or smash it, I'll be delighted haha. I prefer to have low expectations so if and when the market has a shit few years I don't break down and cry!"
2025-10-10,"Totally understand. A lot of verbal (via keyboard) diarrhea all over the internet. You make very valid points don't get me wrong. I used to day trade on margin until it got too stressful. Those are the type ""warnings"" I like to spread. Some people who ask for investing advice online don't know what CD even stands for. I try and .make sure people aren't exposing themselves basically. Like trading on margin lol. But if someone asks for stock picking advice, I tell them my top two good bets in that moment. Which are  NVDA or GRAL right now for me. I 100% agree with the don't trust a stranger on the internet versus someone you trust irl, or your own research."
2025-10-08,"I think the AI bubble is real for smaller cap companies who go up 50%+ on news and don’t have anything to show for it. 

I don’t be believe there is an AI bubble for companies who grow because of AI and implement AI to make themselves better. 

I’m gonna give an example with Nvidia because that’s what I know and I can say that their margins and revenues are unheard of. They control the market, have the best product, their chips are literally sold on the black market, revenues somehow keep growing 50% year of year and margins are literally up to par with software companies. Literally unbelievable how good this company is and it’s all because of AI. They lost China sales yet they still beat estimates against all odds. AI will change the world, surely, and many companies are yet to get the full growth potential from this revolution, but many others who fail to deliver a solid product will eventually be left out. For now, anything AI related will do well. When that will stop? Nobody knows."
2025-10-08,IMO the next crash is not gonna be  the AI bubble but rather buy now pay later 🤷🏼‍♂️
2025-10-09,"Another pointless thread talking about a bubble without explaining WHY op has said conviction about a bubble existing in the first place.

Dot.com had insane valuations with triple digit PEs and no indication of making any revenue out of these valuations. Ok, fair, that was the explanation for that bubble.

This time around the worst PE you see on well rounded mag7 is.. 50? Discounting the troll tickers like tsla which is why I qualified my statement with 'well rounded'. No explanation of why this is a bubble with actual facts or numbers to support it other than numbers have went up consecutively for too long? Or maybe shelling out the dinosaur metric of MC to gdp that buffett uses since the 80s..."
2025-10-10,"This makes sense. The other thing I'm trying to consider is that in the previous ""bubbles"" there was some factor that facilitated a crash like subprime mortgages, or fraud at Enron.. but what we're seeing here is a slew of companies all working together.. Oracle with its cloud infrastructure (I wish it was AWS but thats another story), NVIDIA with the hardware, Open AI with the software.... 

So really this ""bubble"" is just companies working together.

What im wondering is.. if analysts are calling it a bubble.. why is that? It is just them covering their asses? I just dont know.

I didnt end up selling anything yet.. I dont want to sell out of unfounded panic obviously!

some good points in this thread thank you."
2025-10-09,"I’m basing this a lot on the articles I’m reading like the one I linked and this would be for large cap companies like Nvidia and Oracle. It’s starting to seem like a giant circle jerk and it reminds me of 2000.

I’m not talking about getting out entirely because I don’t want to be left behind of course but I feel like pulling out half and taking some profit might be prudent"
2025-10-09,"Listen… I’m not asserting anything I’m asking a question based on reporting that I’m seeing

Go back and read my post. I am soliciting other people’s opinions I am not saying there is a bubble definitively because how in the green fuck would I know that

What I’m asking is… Does it make sense to trim my exposure and I think the answer is yes

So chill out"
2025-10-09,The true is we never know. But a IA bubble is simple. In this case many IA companies are looking for the right rabbit like we do when picking stocks in early stages. Might work might go to 0. If just keep pumping money but not real assets that give substantial value for the future. A product that will stabilize and be everywhere then we have a problem. Everyone is looking for a rabbit. If not US government where would be Intel. 15 years ago was the hot stuff. Everyone knew it. Right?

It is important to know your company, do you understand your company and exactly how it operates and how the cash flow works within that company? Not predicting it’s going up and neither saying that it’s going to go down but you have to follow the money. 

Nvidia lending money as a CapEx item to ChatGPT so that ChatGPT can buy their chips is cautiously reminiscent of Nortel networks if you weren’t trading during the Dot com collapse should go back and do some reading and research on some of these companies and see where things went wrong."

2025-10-09,"If you look at the difference between generative AI videos from when it was first rolled out vs now with SORA 2, that should be enough to convince you this isn't just a bubble. It wont be long until this can produce movie length films, once that happens, the entire film industry (which is approximately worth 308 billion)is toast. And thats just one industry affected by AI.

Not to mention when quantum computing is added into the mix, the sheer possibilities are endless. I foresee the entire game industry being shaken up by AI with generative gaming, VR, etc being rolled out and the game industry is also approx 300 billion in worth. 

Mark my words, jump on the bandwagon while you can."

2025-10-10,"Well I had a fair position in NVDA from about 5 years ago and have taken terrific profits off all the way up. I now have a small, but zero cost basis, position. Each time it makes a new high I sell a few and buy a LEAP put as a hedge. At this point I  play with the banks' money."

2025-10-08,Thanks for the sell signal.
2025-10-08,I know this is a NVDA sub but a this point this company is so large you get a lot of exposure of it just by buying s&p500 and other indexes. Gotta evaluate risk/reward. I see nvda could double to 10 trillion by 2030 but by the the s&p is equally likely to almost double. But on the downside NVDA could definitely fall so much harder than the s&p500. Idk just my opinion. 
2025-10-08,"Yeah people have this mental illness where they think they missed their chance investing in Nvidia and are always looking for the next Nvidia. Nvidia is the next Nvidia.

2025-10-08,"No thank you. I am debating moving my money in no market cap index to avoid the likes of this. I am also already about 60 vxus equivalent. Shit can’t go on for ever. Just think about it right now nvda is worth more than all of Europes markets combined. Let that sink in. Your say a company building computer parts in the US is more valuable than the entire European continent? Time will tell but I am
Not buying it. Esp considering that more than 50% of its revenue is from 3 customers. Who once have built out their data centers will not be buying in same volume. Not to mention the monopoly will shrink as other countries ie china will be forced to produce their own stuff with the tariffs. When I see comments like the first 10 trillion dollar company and 60 year old coworkers blindly buying nvda it worries me to see what come of it. Good luck to all. I own my share as an index holder but that’s it. Congrats to the early buyers that have life changing appreciation m. Good look to all the fomo guys."
2025-10-08,Well like most I own it but what’s the expected upside? I mean a 25% gain in stock price gets you to a 6 trillion dollar valuation. Trying beating that every 3 months. It would be very difficult to buy at this price..if you feel you have to buy start with a small position

2025-10-13,I got 5x with NVDA now but I would not invest more for potential exta 1x. I don't think the market is mentally ready for 10 trillion company
2025-10-08,"Not really, because that would mean it's already priced in, with little room to grow. The way you beat the market in investing is to be right about something that isn't an opinion held by the majority. Now, if you're not interested in that, since there's a lot of risk involved, sure a stock like NVDA can still be good. But the question eventually becomes, why not just invest in an index fund? Index funds pretty much always win in the long run compared to single stocks. The reason people get into single stocks is to take a riskier position in order to have potentially larger gains.

I'm a long time NVDA holder, but NVDA is no longer a ""secret."" Everyone obviously knows about NVDA now. That means the upside is likely not great when compared to other options. It also depends on how much you think the market expects out of GPU-driven AI vs. what it can deliver. It's likely that eventually, a competitor will come along with a better technology, or the face of AI could change.

Currently, I sell a constant fraction of my NVDA shares every year, and convert them into other investments. The major gains are likely over, in the sense that there are much better single stocks to buy now. I expect NVDA to keep going up, but I certainly don't expect the same type of multiplicative growth. It's just unrealistic to expect."

2025-10-08,"To understand how big investments or valuations could claim to exist, it helps to know OpenAI’s unusual hybrid model.
OpenAI was originally founded as a non-profit in 2015. 
Over time, it reorganized so that a “capped-profit” subsidiary (OpenAI LP) is controlled by a non-profit parent. This allows it to raise outside investment while maintaining some mission control. 

Outside investors (e.g. Microsoft, SoftBank) provide funding, typically with caps on their returns (i.e. investors can’t extract unlimited profit). 

Because of that structure, “non-profit” is not quite the same as “no private investment or valuation.” The non-profit is the controlling entity, but the operational arm can still raise and spend large sums. 

So, it is possible for OpenAI (or its subsidiary) to receive huge capital infusions and to be associated with large valuations, even though it has non-profit roots."

2025-10-09,"Considering that shareholders are still getting diluted to this day due to that acquisition, I’d say some PE effect is warranted."
2025-10-07,The problem with AMD is that their profit has barely been growing during a period when NVDA has been growing YoY rapidly. Also AMD has a measly profit margin of 11% compared to NVDA 55%. This is probably due to really bad management and leadership at AMD and if the issues are culturally systemic at the company there may be no easy way to fix it.
2025-10-07,"Like how? 
From the 10% of open AI?

AMD is there for a reason. It is far behind and very hard to catch up. Big AI companies want to invest their billions to tested, safe, efficient chipsets.

Maybe..in the far future.

AMD is in for a hard correction."
2025-10-07,Isn’t that good
2025-10-08,"1. NVDA’s growth is capped because of its size (almost 5trillion market cap).
2. If AMD takes market share, NVDA’s revenue growth and pricing power will shrink.

AMD’s market cap is a fraction in comparison, therefore AMD stock price and revenue growth has a potential that NVDA doesn’t. Some believe the OpenAI deal is confirmation of that potential."
2025-10-07,AMD has low margins coz they mainly rely on their client business which is high competition. Data center revenue was a joke until now but if this deal gets executed over the next few years I definitely expect their margins to climb from 11-12% to closer to 20%. The multiple expansion there could be significant. Don’t forget NVDA was at 20% before the AI boom.
2025-10-07,"I see AMD as a generic version, they’re good, but not top-notch. I’m not downplaying the company, but I figure their chips are going into the toasters and all the low-end items. I seen Nvidia being used where it counts. Both companies are good and I believe both companies will make money for investors."
2025-10-08,it is good that’s what i’m saying. insane revenue

2025-10-08,"Only if they execute, if not, the multiples collapse. NVIDIA is still market leader (92% market share) and AI is still being built on CUDA. OpenAI still buys NVIDIA, this is just diversification for OpenAI in order not to be stuck with only NVIDIA. Lots of IFs still for AMD while NVIDIA already has certainty"
2025-10-07,AMDs AI chips will never have margins like nvidias one. they drop prices because they are not competitive at all. they literally gave ai chips for openai FOR FREE AND GOT 10% OF THE COMPANY LOL
2025-10-08,"Such a profitable company ay, future looks good for nvidia if earnings keep performing"
2025-10-08,Holding
2025-10-08,"You don't understand the deal at all.  OpenAI will be purchasing billions of dollars worth of AMD chips.  AMD's stock warrants have stipulations including chip purchases and also share price targets for AMD stock.  For example, the last set of warrants are only exercise-able if AMD reaches a $600 share price.  They reach that share price by selling billions and billions in chips.

It's a great deal for AMD for them to get their foot in the door, get more adoption of their chips, which will bring more free developers into their open source software platform.  That's why their share price jumped 30%, it's not because everyone is dumb and AMD gave their chips and company to OpenAI ""FOR FREE""."
2025-10-07,Who said they’ll have margins like nvda? They’ll gain market share regardless of how good nvda is. There is a reason openAI chose AMD despite them being the second best. And no they are not giving openAI chips for free. They literally secured 10s of billions for the next few years. Learn how businesses work and you can make money too
2025-10-08,They made the deal because amd couldnt just sell chips. Cope more
2025-10-09,"If you think AMD having to literally cannibalize themselves to sell their inferior product on the prayer that they get some customer lock in is a good thing, then I don’t know what to tell you.

2025-10-06,Nothing about this deal is bearish for nvidia open AI has already committed to buying more nvidia than amd
2025-10-07,"The CEO’s are cousins, it’s not an accident that nvda invested 100b in open ai a short time ago and now OpenAI is investing in AMD."
2025-10-08,Some folks are using Coke and Pepsi as a comparison.   Not a bad idea.  Pepsi is big but when you look around the world they aren't really much of a threat to Coke.  I'm only talking about the beverages not their portfolio of other companies.   Nvidia is Coke and unless they screw up they will own the market for a long time.
2025-10-06,Are they just using the “$100B” investment to buy a lesser product because they’re legally not allowed to turn around and buy Nvidia
2025-10-09,“bought” not buyed
2025-10-07,"Here's where you're mistaken, you're assuming that AMD is good enough. Coke and Pepsi are similar enough, NVDA and AMD are not. They are settling on tofu because they can't get any more waygu steak atm. But they still have to feed the beast."
2025-10-07,They are buying because AMD offers compelling value. Huge companies don't need CUDA or Nvidia because the can write their own code and build their own hardware.
2025-10-10,"Because if you talk to any AI/ML engineer who has worked with both AMD and NVIDIA chips. 
Working on NVIDIA chips is far superior to AMD. It is not even a comparison in terms of efficiency and development time. AMD is cheaper and can get the job done with a lot more time invested, but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for."
2025-10-07,"I believe so. This may change when Nvidia releases the next generation chip, because they will likely increase the gap in performance to AMD.

One thing is clear: capital expenditures on AI are not nearing a climax. This build-out could last another 2-3 years. Combined with falling interest rates and increased earnings, the environment will likely be very favorable for technology stocks."
2025-10-08,"Because they aren't settling for 'lesser quality chips'

Back in June, Sam Altman was on stage with Lisa Su at the Advancing AI event and confirmed back then that OpenAI already had AMD's Instinct MI450X rack-scale system in-hand, and liked it so much, he confirmed OpenAI is now committing resources to help AMD with the design of their MI450X rack-scale system, and had their software engineers ensure ROCm was tight for these new chips, because he thinks the MI450X is ""amazing"" and was planning to deploy them.

Altman went on to say that when he was first told the specifications for the new AMD MI400X and MI450X series, he found them so ambitious that he thought they were ""totally crazy"".

Altman specifically noted that the MI450X's memory architecture is ""great for inference"" but also sees its potential for training AI models, and they absolutely plan on deploying both chips, but especially the MI450X rack-scale system.

So...Altman admitted that he thought the new specs of the AMD chips were crazy; he's already had them in-hand for partner testing for months now, saying the MI450X rack-scale system is amazing. He thought it was so amazing that he then partnered with AMD to help them finish designing it and have his software guys tighten up ROCm for the new series, because he plans on deploying them. 

If Sam Altman thought these were 'lesser quality chips' than Nvidia's and didn't believe any of what he actually said; he's not going up on stage with Lisa Su and say all that at an Advancing AI event, and he certainly wouldn't decide to commit OpenAI resources to help AMD design the MI450X rack-scale system, or have his engineers help bring ROCm up to snuff and tight for this release.

Altman clearly believes in what he's been testing and designing. OpenAI doing all that testing and design with AMD this year is why the recent deal was done with AMD to get the MI450X rack-scale systems, because he already confirmed they're testing it, helping design it, and will deploy it, back in June.

I think Nvidia's new chip will probably beat AMD's new chip in training, but not by a crazy amount, and AMD has been designing for killing it in the Inference stage because as Lisa Su has continuously said, and Jensen confirmed, Inference is where the real money is! You're moving from spending huge money on learning and training, to now monetization of AI models at scale. Inference actually delivers the business value to end-users and other companies. So your GPU chip better kick ass at Inference, otherwise companies won't be able to realize the benefits of all the money they poured into the other stages, and they'll move to a GPU that will allow them to realize those benefits. The AI industry is now widely considered to be entering the Inference phase.

While I would agree AMD has been a 'lesser quality chip' in the past, it hasn't been because of terrible AMD hardware, but with the ROCm software playing catch up. The software has come along way already, and the latest ROCm release was a really big step forward.

So you can believe and say the AMD MI400X and MI450X series chips that OpenAI are buying are still lesser quality chips, but it no longer means you're right. You'e basically saying OpenAI committed resources to help AMD design the MI450X rack-scale system and do ROCm work for MI400X and MI450X series that in the end, is all just going to use an inferior AMD GPU chip compared to Nvidia's. I wouldn't bet on that. But don't let me try and convince ya, you'll see once released.

In the end, buy Nvidia and AMD and hold for years, like me 😂"
2025-10-07,"This is super incorrect across the board. First, OpenAI isn't 'just a chatbot', and even if thats the only product they had, they have something like 800 million visits a week. The amount of compute required to power that is incredible. 

Second, not a single company you mentioned picks Nvidia because ""it doesn't fail as easy"". Nvidia has always dominated this part of the market and build better cards for these purposes. AMD has built really good cards for AI as well, they just aren't as good. Nothing to do with reliability/failure. 

Third, you must have used an AMD gpu many years ago. The differences are not nearly as incredible as they used to be. Latency is BS and AMD has gotten pretty competitive on raw processing power. I've used latest gen of both, so thats not me just saying that. 

Companies are looking at AMD for a few reasons, the most obvious is that Nvidia likely can't handle all the demand they have right now. Additionally, companies don't want to be chained to Nvidia, and they'd be willing to lose a bit of compute for the benefit of not being tied to one company for all of their computational needs. Imagine what happens to a compute-centric business if Nvidia decides their allocation of GPU's would better fit a different company."
2025-10-07,"Google, Amazon and Microsoft have their own custom AI hardware. They buy Nvidia for their cloud CUSTOMERS to use."

Tempting to sell some shares but I just wouldn't know where to park the profits and then id have to pay taxes on it.
2025-10-07,That’s why I invested in both back in 2018. Fortunately I had way more NVDA than AMD. Still sitting on 2200 shares of AMD. The unfortunate thing is I sold Dec CCs at 2 hundie.

It's really mind boggling some of the nonsense written by people that know absolutely nothing about what Nvidia has done, what it has yet to do, and the impact that AI will have in the near and far future! No, it's not a bubble, and no it's not going to burst! AI is the biggest and most significant technological revolution we have had since the introduction of the internet! Nvidia has minted more millionaires than any other stock in the history of the market and to think that it is going to slow down or go through significant devaluation, requires a special level of not only ignorance but pure stupidity.

@ $18-$25 it was a deal. Now it's being pumped beyond it's worth, but who knows they supposedly started production in Arizona. Not entirely excited about how it's turning out but I would rather someone in the US make chips in case China decides Taiwan looks juicy or something....

wondering how long it will take the market to realize this after it starts its kneejerk selloff?"
2025-10-06,I really don’t think people understand the OpenAI deal with NVDA. It is an agreement to pay $10b per data center up to ten data centers. In return they get a 2% stake in OpenAI. They have the option to do that ten times (up to $100b; for 20% at the current valuation). This wasn’t some instant deal. The first data centers won’t start until next year at the earliest. And therefore NVDA hasn't given any money and gotten any stake in OpenAI.

2025-10-07,AMD should invest in Nvidia to complete the loop
2025-10-08,"Not for free. They buy large amount of GPU from AMD, causing its stock to moon. Then OpenAI gets 10% of AMD for almost nothing. This is the new economy  we are in."
2025-10-06,I found really fun no one see what is going on. AI companies investing in others that will invest in theirs also as a circle ⭕️ without actually bringing nothing to the table. Meaning the so call AI bubble 🫧 is growing the % of build and burst 💥. I do not invest in stock alone but would feel the pain nevertheless. Hope it stops this fake market hype of AI before crash. I will feel maybe in 15% to 20% of my portfolio. Others will burn all their money if this nonsense keeps going on.
2025-10-07,AMD invests in Intel and Intel pays government…..wait wtf?
2025-10-07,"Congratulations, you might be the only person here that has bothered to read what this deal actually entails."
2025-10-07,In a recent interview with Jensen he mentioned he expects OpenAI to become the next 1Tn$ company. There are not many other companies they can meaningfully invest on at their scale
2025-10-06,On AMD. Yes good idea
2025-10-06,ikr... where all the money openai get from? ads revenue? lol
2025-10-07,"just did that, 226 -> 205 wasnt too bad!"
2025-10-07,I hold both so idk why they down voted
2025-10-07,"If you believe the whole value chain will 10-100x in the next decade (which the incumbents do) it makes sense to invest in other steps of the chain. In this capex-leading phase it does look like circling money, but as revenues grow and outpace capex eventually, it’ll let them capture more that revenue inflow"
2025-10-07,Ok. So if i sell you an orange for 5 dollars. You sell your counting same orange for now 6 dollars and your cousin sell me the same orange for now 7 dollars. What is really creating? This is exactly what is going on now. Trying buying time to see if IA can be really successful before it finds out for the moment is too young technology for the price everyone is buying stocks.
2025-10-07,How long
2025-10-08,"Lol terrible analogy that doesn’t apply to Nvidia, Open AI, and AMD. They all have different products and markets in the same sector. But yes that is how supermarkets make money on oranges."
2025-10-07,"They weren't good yeah, but still decided to take the risk. I didn't expect it to fall in one day. My puts were a few weeks out. Still a profit though so not complaining"
2025-10-06,"I’ll sell when I need the money, nothing else."
2025-10-06,If the government gave a one time sell tax free
2025-10-06,when openAi invest in AMD
2025-10-06,When it goes to $1000
2025-10-07,"I did sell. Profit. They’re absolutely will be some volatility ahead and I can get back in. I’m a long-term believer in Nvidia, but I have short-term compulsions and a short term timeline."
2025-10-06,"nothing macro related, nothing related to any country's debt, nothing about a recession or job loss rising due to A.I. itself replacing jobs and causing a recession.

no cpi print, no ppi print, no dot plot or inverse yield curve, no tariffs, nothing manipulated or manufactured by the government. That includes war, including our own troops.

the only thing that would get me to sell is when companies stop giving NVDA their money. And they can't just say they are going to stop, no they actually have to physically stop. I feel like this is an important distinction because we've already seen a variation of this to some degree. Nothing else really matters."
2025-10-06,"When the shares are ripped from my cold, dead hands! (However, to the point of poster above about Jensen health, would like to see other C-suite folks represent more publicly)"
2025-10-06,When NVDA hits $400
2025-10-07,$400/share after another 1-10 split
2025-10-06,I’m holding.
2025-10-06,"Declining 50-day moving average and several days closing below it would lead me to consider taking partial profits or hedging.

We are likely far from that moment. NVDA is pulling back but holding near its prior all-time high, a textbook re-test. I won't even pay attention to the shorter-term time frames unless it were to close below 184 for more than a few days, or lose the 180 area. Then, we're looking at a potential failed breakout, and that could ignite more selling."
2025-10-06,$400 a share
2025-10-07,If it went to $1000 a share next week ..
2025-10-07,"If there is a clear separation between earnings and stock valuation,  which indicate a bubble."
2025-10-07,I’ll sell some bc it’s now 90% of my portfolio 😂
2025-10-06,When Nvidia reaches $5B. What do you think?
2025-10-06,"Agreed.

Also by then anyone still holding with be a bagholder.

....I know it goes without saying, but this is the Internet. Stating the obvious is the bread and butter"
2025-10-07,"It's going to be a long time before it goes to a thousand, they like retail being able to afford shares so they do splits. Unless you're talking about sans the split in which case we're at $1,855 right now lol"
2025-10-06,"You are not thinking about the long game! Quantum computing is where it’s going and it’s Nvidia and IBM that are leading the way. Jensen is leaving a Legacy, he loves to work and is always looking for solutions to problems that nobody else can see!"
2025-10-06,Been holding since 2015  I’m tracking early retirement. Probably holding for the next 5-10 years unless the above happens. That’s my gameplan just how my timeline is. You do you
2025-10-07,"Apple stock fell pretty sharply (like 10%) on break of the news, but recovered over time. Additionally tim cook was a worthy successor, though there's been some missteps with AI lately, partly due to leadership within Apple. 

For Nvidia, I can't think of anybody who would be worthy to take over, specifically because his senior leadership teams within Nvidia are fairly specialized. Eg. Legendary names like Ian Buck and Chris Malachowsky are more technical oriented, and I can't think of any senior leaders who have both business and technical backgrounds like JHH

Jensen is THE man when it comes to making and sealing deals."
2025-10-06,55k shares here and holding for a decade as well planning for early retirement though?
2025-10-09,is nvda still a buy at this price point? at $188?
2025-10-06,"Too late.
I was going to buy this morning in premarket. But it shot up 35% on open"
2025-10-06,Buy more shares until you reach 100. Then buy more until you reach 200
2025-10-06,Sell 6000 and let the rest ride
2025-10-06,Hold it like it’s hot
2025-10-06,Sell your house and belongings and all in on NVDA.
2025-10-06,Trim into undervalued stocks like UNH but otherwise hold until retirement
2025-10-06,"My rule of thumb is to always take partial profits on a double.

You're pretty close.

You could use a stop loss to protect your gains on some of the shares. For example, sell some if NVDA closes below 180 for more than a day or two. This would be the only short-term scenario that would concern me in this stock."
2025-10-07,"I would hold it, or even add. Hold no matter what, add depending on what percentage it is of your portfolio."
2025-10-07,Hold it
2025-10-07,Rationally speaking hold. The Fed is easing rates and this rally shows no signs of abating. Don’t buy more that’s way too risky. Once you see genuine signs of market failure sell.
2025-10-07,"Hold it and buy a set amount monthly. Aquire a really good understanding of the tax codes, specifically the taxes on short-term gains vs long-term gains."
2025-10-07,Definitely hold it at least until April of next year. I'm getting hit with some short term capital gains this year because I thought they were long term.
2025-10-07,Holdl
2025-10-08,"Sell some and spend the profits.   Look for other positions and build something diversified. 
No greater happiness than finding money."
2025-10-08,It’s too small to take profits. Hold and keep investing until you need it.
2025-10-08,SELL
2025-10-08,"I’d say hold. You don’t want to pay short-term capital gains. You already halfway there. Plus, it’s probably gonna grow and grow and grow."
2025-10-09,I would hold. Once it’s over 200% then I would sell 15-20% to take some profit off get table. That’s just me. I don’t know your financial situation
2025-10-11,"If you think it’s a long term play, add, if not  take profits. My strongest conviction over the next 3-5 years."
2025-10-11,"Sell $6,000 to get your money back and hold the rest to see what happens."
2025-10-06,I wish I could. I am sure this is a solid investment. I wish someone would have lend me 1 million dollars when nvidia hit $84
2025-10-07,How much partial profits would you take on a double?
2025-10-06,Buy more until 300
2025-10-06,Buy more until you reach 300
2025-10-07,I typically self half. Then I take out my initial investment and the rest is house money.
2025-10-06,"What are you actually asking? Just keep investing money until you need it, usually at retirement. No one knows which stock is best."
2025-10-06,I feel this guy knows insider news on NVIDIA as every time i see his post the stock pumps that day. Or maybe thats coincidence.
2025-10-06,"Lmao you know that bad boy did a stock split. Nvidia is actually 1,850 ish a share."
2025-10-07,Market capitalization is different compared to AMD’s also Nvidia did a stock split so the value is still 2 times higher
2025-10-06,"Here’s a thought. Why don’t you and apooroldinvestor get a room? Better yet , there was a redditor named Colombian something something that kept spouting $150 (who deleted all his comments btw) go get each other off."
2025-10-07,"I remember the 1985 Yahoo Bulletin boards pump and dump. You’re late to the game, brothers. This is the problem with you dudes, you post this bullshit, do you know real money players will feast on you like sharks, you’re throwing blood in the water, shut the fuck up, let Nvidia run to 500, but if you keep posting this shit it’s gonna be fucking 150; I just remember 1985 Yahoo Bulletin boards pump and dump. You’re late to the game, brothers."
2025-10-06,I kept posting proof apooroldinvestor is a fraud and it blocked me 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
2025-10-06,"Yeah, it also would ask the most basic of investing questions, then turn around and act like some sage. I think mods only allow it because engagement > quality discussion"
2025-10-06,"""Should I invest my money safely, or should I gamble it all away? Let's ask chatgpt"""
2025-10-06,"RGTI makes like 1-2m quarterly, -100% net profit margin and valued at 13B. This is basically gambling."
2025-10-06,investing > gambling
2025-10-06,I'm hoping for a green day too but futes are up 0.24%. No offence but that's hardly worth getting excited about...
2025-10-06,This guy is Cramer !  He yells green stick goes red.
2025-10-06,$500
2025-10-06,"They are currently hovering around a 4 trillion dollar evaluation, at a stock price under $200 a share, for it to sell at $1000 a share they would need to be worth $20 billion dollars, or the number of shares would have to be reduced, either by a share buy back or a reverse stock split. It could happens it will take years unless some other major developments effect the company."
2025-10-06,Webull is decent
2025-10-05,"I remember when somebody told me that Apple was overpriced at $211 and then I was a moron for buying it… That was back in 2011.. that same investment would allow me to pay off my house if I chose to… Twice

The difference between a good investor and a bad investor is patience. Buy the dips and keep the faith"
2025-10-05,"Been hearing this ""$200 soon"" for awhile now.

https://youtu.be/hnpILIIo9ek?si=6bgxoJsMEFqRqOhO"
2025-10-06,Nvidia to $5000 in the future. You heard it from me first so apologize now so you don't need to do it later...
2025-10-05,"$200 will finally get here but NVDA will blow through it to $300. $200 will be a post-consolidation achievement. Next is a sling shot to $300 on consolidation release. Maybe $350. Then another consolidation, so there’s that. Time frame: few years.
It could also go to 80 if the world were to crash and burn. Gotta keep this in mind considering current depraved leadership shenanigans."
2025-10-05,I need an apology from citron for shorting it a while back and put out a hit piece. I apologize to myself for not having the courage to hold n buy more 😓. Those guys are db
2025-10-06,You only jinxing it and we not at $200
2025-10-06,When i see these posts i know we hit the reversal… anyhow buyzedip
2025-10-08,NO apologies from me.. I'm holding 4000 free shares from $46 2019 pre split.. forever hold!!
2025-10-06,Only for good companies with strong moat

2025-10-06,LOLOL truuuuuu BuT it was because of that that we were able to buy at $120 a share and hold hold hold till $300
2025-10-06,I remember when it went from $6 to $600 that would be Obama FOR THE WIN!😂😂
2025-10-06,Neeeh. It basically did nothing under Obama and only started moving in 2016 when Trump entered the race.
2025-10-07,But if I’m being fair I have absolutely done that at times. 🤣 it’s easy to forget there are real people (I hope) still left on Reddit
2025-10-06,"Well, my strategy is pretty simple. I just refuse to sell ha ha.. I sold some in 2020 to redo our back yard and pool, and I regret it!"
2025-10-06,"I also checked, and I was slightly off, I got my OLDEST shares (that I still have) in 2016. Adjusted price of $22 and about 540 shares.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I had some from earlier, but I stand behind the advice.   If you believe in the company, be a long term investor.

I worked with a lady who left my company for NVDA in 2014.. and I wonder how much those stock options are worth now and if she kept them"
2025-10-06,Nothing but congrats to your intelligent thinking. I still think Nvidia and Apple are good long term plays. What’s your opinion? Idk about Tesla I don’t really believe in them long term
2025-10-05,If it goes to $200 then I can finally afford that same svelte leather jacket
2025-10-05,No. Will hit $5T so that’s going to be around ~$205.41
2025-10-05,"Bro deleted his godfather meme post, cos it sucked. So why don’t you post another Pepe meme holding his pp?"
2025-10-05,Never selling
2025-10-06,So a $205 covered call for 7 days? Got it.
2025-10-06,If you bought low good deal! If you bought at 184. Meh.
2025-10-08,"Geez spit out random predictions.  Next week it'll be 1000.  

Why not discuss something like there is a catalyst etc."
2025-10-05,"*Buy on Monday or you will completely miss it*

That’s not how the market works. It’s also open Tuesday through Friday, not counting the occasional holiday or event.

Hope that helps!"

2025-10-05,"You could only afford if you are going to sell NVDA, but we know that NVDA is ""HODL till I die!"""

2025-10-06,"Never? So your plan is to make it part of a legacy trust? Genuine question. I have a couple investments up 25,000% and 14,500% which I'll also make into a legacy trust. So what percentage of your portfolio is NVDA?"
2025-10-05,Please just buy an index fund
2025-10-05,Thank you Jensen Huang for showing nbis love. 40%+ 20 days. Target $200 eom and $800 eoy 2026. Then $1000!
2025-10-06,1K is a long way off fool
2025-10-08,You people and your stupid posts nothing happened and won't for a long long time
2025-10-05,"Based on what earnings?

Or only on the Microsoft deal?"
2025-10-05,"I am waiting it out before buying, as $NBIS is ATH. Unfortunate for me because I bought it at 36, held it and just before it went to 90, I had sold my shares thinking there would be a sell of. 

Not financial advice."
2025-10-07,I agree it's a drop in the bucket. Nvidia swings 45-90bn (1 or 2 percent)  in either direction most days. $33m isn't much in this case.
2025-10-06,"Yarbrough is considered to be the smartest investor in the space.



At least that’s what Mrs. Yarbrough told me."
2025-10-05,"It’s 165,592 more shares than you probably have"
2025-10-05,Probably wish invested into Boeing
2025-10-04,"Yall are a little unrealistic. 

Let’s say you invest responsibly today, maybe 10% if your liquid NW. Let’s say it goes on a 5x from here? That’s going to be a $23T+ market cap! Do you guys understand how big that Is? There’s almost not enough money supply to support such a company? That is almost macroeconomically impossible! For what? 5x? That’s not going to turn you into a leisure robot  🤷🏼‍♂️"
2025-10-05,"Nvidia cancels, price drops. someone nicer buys the plots?"
2025-10-04,I just realized that Shin-Kong Life has learnt a few tricks from POTUS when negotiation with Nvidia about the profits.
2025-10-04,Just hold…let’s get to $200 first.
2025-10-04,"No, it will be at $13,235.47 by August 1st 2030. My crystal ball says it shall be."
2025-10-04,Please !!!!I’m happy if it reached $250 next year!!!😑
2025-10-04,"Short answer. Yes. 

Long answer. Yessssssssssssssssssssss."
2025-10-04,Technically its at $1876 a share if the 10/1 split never happened
2025-10-04,"If big tech continues to spend high on AI capex + AGI is a reality by 2030 then it has the chance to reach a 10 trillion dollar valuation.

To reach a $1000 per share it would have to reach a 24.3 trillion dollar valuation which is a little ridiculous to expect in just 5 years. Maybe in the next 50 years if things continue and the demand for compute is high + Nvidia is a leader in the next iteration of compute (quantum).

I’m happy with a 10% annualized return for the next 5 years, if you are expecting much more it sounds like you are chasing the gains we experienced before the AI boom. You are better off finding a $1b company with the potential to be a $10b if you want those type of outsized returns."
2025-10-04,"No, hopefully $400"
2025-10-04,The stock price would need to increase 40% CAGR to hit $1000 in 2030. It's almost impossible to maintain this growth rate imo.
2025-10-04,"Actually it’s going to be$56,786.09 … give or take a penny;)"
2025-10-04,$1000 by 2027
2025-10-04,Im thinking more around $450
2025-10-05,I think they would have to get exceedingly aggressive buying back shares for it to get much above $400 by 2030.
2025-10-04,"People tend to think in term of share price, rookies. When you think in term of market cap, it is 25 trillions. Now, do you think it it realistic?"
2025-10-04,Yes definitely if cost of milk shoots up to $100 per gallon
2025-10-04,"It's likely when hyperinflation hits. The $1,000 may be worth just $23 in 2025 dollars"
2025-10-04,"No, but not for he reasons you think. It would split before it hit $1000."
2025-10-04,"No, it won’t. In fact it might never. Do you realize the total market cap would be $6.5 trillion. That would be insane and will involve a lot of things we wouldn’t want. So, no it won’t l."
2025-10-04,Only if the currency is devalued significantly. Doable
2025-10-04,"Literally no one has a clue. By 2030 we’ll have a new president with new policies and priorities, and we’ll see if AI has untapped potential that’s useful for every industry or if it was really a bubble the whole time. There are about a million factors that someone would have to guess correctly in order to know the stock price in 2030."
2025-10-04,What do you think we will see end of Year? 220-250$?
2025-10-04,"Will the most value stock increase 530% in 4.25 years?


No, no it will not.   At some point you have to start comparing the market cap relative to the GDP of COUNTRIES.   Right now it's worth more than the ENTIRE GDP of GERMANY.


Going to $1000 would put it over the GDP of CHINA.



So no."
2025-10-04,Didn’t it almost reach $1000? It got like $950 and then split 1:10
2025-10-04,"Company like Axon has 56B cap and it is at 700$ , hell yeah Nvidia can reach 1000$ and probably will."
2025-10-04,"Yes, $24.3 trillion dollar market cap. It’s only gotta be able half of the SP500 today and a third of the total US Market Cap"
2025-10-05,"Learn about company accounting.
Sales and profits would have to be 5x todays numbers.
Is that realistic in 5 years? 
Not likely."
2025-10-05,"Yes, but bread will cost $50."
2025-10-05,"Yes, when eggs are $100 a dozen."
2025-10-05,Nvidia is extremely undervalued.
2025-10-05,Oct 2029 according to this: [https://longforecast.com/nvidia](https://longforecast.com/nvidia)
2025-10-06,Oh yeah most definitely! I have a nice set of crystal balls and can predict the future. I also predict you will be the owner of a very crappy non-diversified portfolio and will have underperformed market benchmarks.
2025-10-06,"It’s gone 12x in the last 5 years. To say 5x in the next 5 years is unlikely based upon the big number argument alone is not smart.  It’s definitely doable. However it depends on so many things we don’t know yet about the integration of compute in society, NVIDIA’s dominance, China competition (China may compete globally if Nvidia not allowed in, or at least put margin pressure- Nvidia needs access to prevent China from mimicking the ‘stack ecosystem’). I’d say 5X is the most bullish case, 2X bearish, 3X is the over/under, inmho."
2025-10-06,"Another 20 or something year old with four shares posting.  Ya, possible buddy.  Pass the ketchup."
2025-10-07,"Do your own DD and look at OPTT. This fifty-cent stock received two buy ratings last week and one of them is a STRONG BUY. Houses don't commonly give ratings on stocks priced at half a buck. Here is what may be happening: OPTT is the first marine AI energy company that can mobilize a craft without a driver. They have recently garnered government defense contracts. They are moving their New Jersey headquarters to DC area. Again, look into this. And remember, we gave you OKLO, NNE, and SMR and of course are long on PLUG"
2025-10-07,Lmao That would make its market cap $24.35 trillion never going to happen

2025-10-04,"No, but UNH will reach $1200"
2025-10-04,"Right now, NVDA is ~$4 trillion dollar company.  Share price is around $180.  At a share price of $1000, that means NVDA will have a ~$22 trillion valuation.

The entire world economy is worth about $115 trillion.  At a 3% growth rate, that becomes about $133 trillion by 2030.

I guess you have to ask yourself whether you believe NVDA, by itself, can bear a market cap that compares to almost 1/6 of the entire world economy in 2030?

Anything is possible, I suppose.  I do own some NVDA stock, so I'd certainly love to see it grow another 5-6x in the next 5 years.  I'm just not sure it's realistic or sustainable."
2025-10-04,Nahhh I’ve heard they  might skip 200 and go straight away to 1000$

2025-10-04,"Agree, when I first purchased NVDA price was $425.00.   LOL, I read $42.50, so instead of ten shares I bought one share.  It’s split a few times since and bought more on the dip.   Now have about 250 shares with different cost basis, but the early stock  purchases have a cost basis of 25.00."
2025-10-04,$400 seems too low considering the time horizon. Who knows. You could be right

2025-10-04,"Numeracy is in short supply, my friend."
2025-10-04,I am gonna keep holding though 🎶
2025-10-04,NVDA would need to hit about 11 trillion in market cap for $400. Being reasonable I think it will be $400
2025-10-04,"It’s only trading at about 50x earnings, if it doubles over that time and earnings continue to beat estimates it could easily go to 10 trillion and still maintain a reasonable price to earnings and price to sales."
2025-10-04,"Dude! The total US stock market cap is roughly $65 trillions at the moment, while NVDA is $4.56 trillions. In other words, NVDA makes up about 7% of the market. If I am being optimistic, I says 10% belongs to NVDA on a good day. So you’re telling me the total US stock market cap could reach $250 trillions in 5 years? Lol, what a nut job."
2025-10-04,"Similar to APPL,  in the 80’s  In 1999 my original 128 were not worth much then. All my friends said I should sell and put in a 529 college fund.  I said no way.  I’m a Bag-holder.   Never thought my 401k would not be my retirement $$, but a buffer on tax gains.  Apple has made me a few million now, but cost basis so low under $0.25.  So HOLD HOLD HOLD if you believe in the Company.  FYI, I worked for Apple in the 80’s.  Best company I’ve ever worked for.  Favorite tag line “The Power to be your Best”.  Relevant then and rings still true today.  Nvidia has this same Power. Sorry so long and a bit off the track"
2025-10-04,Good point.
2025-10-04,"Come back and read this post. In the meantime, try reading the 10k report, and see if you understand it."
2025-10-04,Just 7 years ago there were zero trillion $ companies. Now we have one on It's way to 5 trillion.  When we first had 1 trillion they said it won't make 2.  Then it won't make 3....... 25 is just another number.

2025-10-04,"There is a physical limit for how big a a company can be. No company can become 100T (hyperinflation excluded). 

Also (why youre wrong); the SP500 is valued at 45T, on avg it grows with 8-10% a year, in 5 years it will be 70T, yet you believe nvidia to be 25T, roughly 36% of the total market? Yeah that does sound realistic"

2025-10-04,"That is a worthwhile point. It’s also worth noting it does completely dominate the AI and gaming markets, which are huge. Remember also, it is 55 times earnings - meaning it earns over 80 billion dollars a year. Some of this it spends on share buybacks and some on investment.

But you have to know the potential size of the markets it addresses in order to work out its potential market value. Is its addressable market half a trillion? If so, its value should be even higher than today."
2025-10-05,"No physical limit for cash, though. As long as we need processors and nvda doesn't get beat by competitors or restricted/partitioned by governments, they could in theory grow indefinitely"
2025-10-04,"It's true value should be higher today, but isn't due to the stock splits that happened right?"
2025-10-05,"Stock splits only make the stock more liquid. It means it’s easier for the general market to buy a stock for, say, $200 than $4,000. So if the stock is, say, $4,000 per share, they might do a 20 for 1 split.


Instead of having 3 shares worth $12,000, you now have 60 shares worth $12,000.
The number of shares changes, but everything else stays the same. The company might have just  increased earnings but the earnings PER SHARE has decreased."
2025-10-04,"""Buying now is a bad time because it might go down."" He actually said this. No reasons, no analysis, nothing to support that statement or rationalize why it might retrace to the support levels he's calling out. 

I hope no one is paying for this ""analysis""."
2025-10-05,"I doubt I’d buy more at this price,but 170-175 could be tempting"
2025-10-04,No... Apparently he's still playing with his frog he's got one hand holding mothers cellphone the other is in his pants.
2025-10-04,"Only salty libs will argue actual earnings aren‘t there.  If it’s such a bubble, why are you in the world’s  largest company subreddit?"
2025-10-04,"Well the tarrifs certainly help but the tax cuts from the big beautiful bill are the main driving factor. Deregulation, closing the borders and a focus on American made products also help"
2025-10-04,"Okay this is pretty delusional. You are thinking stocks have done well because of Trump when the reality is they have done well in spite.

The tarrifs have done a lot of damage as buissness have been timid to make investments which has slowed down growth.

The campaign against immigrants has also hurt buissness, though not really in the tech sector. Farmers are in deep finacial trouble atm and cant find labor 

Idk what you mean about focus on American products we are having to import more and there is no hope of building buissness here because the tarrif volatility has everyone too scared to invest. The is just too much uncertainty.

Trump has not crashed the economy but he has slowed us down we could all be way richer right now if we had just stuck to the previous admins economic plan."
2025-10-03,"200 just a matter of time, just a question of what lowest price you can enter in"
2025-10-03,"Don't FOMO anymore and start buying now, DCA in small amounts when it's at all time highs.

I started NVDA DCA last march when things crashed and haven't regretted it at all"
2025-10-03,"It's going to bounce around $190 for a bit before moving solidly and holding above it. Figure out how much you want to own and start buying it in chunks, don't buy it all at once. 

It'll do the same when it gets to $200. Lots of people use these round numbers as targets when they planned to sell. There are still a LOT of buyers out there. Heard this AM that 75% of managers are trailing their benchmarks... and they'll need to jump on the big stocks that have made these gains to catch up. NVDA is a major one of these."
2025-10-04,"I loaded on Nvidia when it was around 100 but the worst thing is I wanted to buy Nvidia few years ago when if was around 15 but my friend who was experienced investor was advising againts it so J heede his advice.
This just shows you that some decisions you have to make on your own."
2025-10-04,It dipped to $185 this afternoon. Did you make it in?
2025-10-05,Buy in when you can for what you can.  Never risk more than you can afford to lose.  But Nvidia is only going up in the long term and had and will make a lot of people quite well off but it is going to change so many mores lives with the returns.
2025-10-04,Top is in boys. Time to sell it all
2025-10-03,"My only regret was not buying more, but like everyone else I didn't know what was going to happen and risk it all and only bought in small amounts at first."
2025-10-03,"Yup, DCA is the best strat for middle class people without huge amounts of money for lump sums and they want less risk.

I've seen posts from people that waited months and months saving up for that big lump sum investment when they could've just been DCAing it that whole time. 😔"
2025-10-03,I heard from an insider it’s going to $600. Trust me bro
2025-10-03,"Hint: for nvda price to move up, someone needs to buy which must mean someone needs to sell."
2025-10-03,This moron was saying NVDA was overvalued 3 years ago too.

2025-10-04,P/E of 26. Not selling.
2025-10-04,If I listened to these so called experts I wouldn't have bought in back in 2019 and just kept buying in up to last Friday and I'll buy a little more next Friday.

2025-10-05,$220 by end of year.
2025-10-05,I know someone some at $96 earlier this year
2025-10-03,"The overconfidence of people in nvda especially in this sub really makes me think twice about just selling it now. Sure it’s a great company but it’s gotten to the point where it’s a bubble waiting to pop just look at the 3 way “financial engineering” they got going on with OpenAI and Oracle. 

Eventually it’s gonna drop down and correct."
2025-10-03,$200.00 before the end of the year seems more likely. We’ll see

2025-10-03,"Jim labenthal , I am sure I’ve misspelled his surname.  He’s often on the noon hour segment.  He is a very well spoken guy and often interesting insights. But like all analysts, like good ol Louis Rukheiser used to say “even the experts can be wrong”.   For me, staying long has been incredibly successful.  The vast majority of analysts while are expecting a correction from 4-10%,  believe we are in no bubble and the bull market has plenty of runway.  If you are not in it , you will miss more and more and more ATHs. Not myself."

Palantir bought for $91284 sold for $91383 = $400

Nvidia bought for $74594 sold for $76124 = $1530

Broadcom bough fur $29578 sold for $30781 = $1203

Hertz bought for $68500 sold for 68400 =  - $100

2025-10-02,I have 10 190 covered calls sitting out there for 10/17.  Now the biggest curiosity is what strike price to move those to a month or so from now. Do I do 200 or just top it at 195 30 days out? What would you do
2025-10-03,Should I invest some more if I already bought 1k?
2025-10-03,"As long as there's still a huge demand for AI infrastructure, and there's no alternative technology for that, NVIDIA will have the same ride or even better than Tesla in 2023."

2025-10-03,Not exactly and it depends. Sometimes I'll try to roll it out a week or so and I might have to eat a little bit of a loss. Sometimes I might pick a week or two in the future and roll it out to a higher price and take a little bit of a credit. I've done both.  The goal if you do anything should always be to get a credit on any rollout. But there are some times where that just doesn't work

Then, over the last 6 months Nvidia is up 70%, up from a $2 trillion valuation from the April low. While Tesla is up 62% during the same time period, again less than 1/4th the valuation

2025-10-02,"LLMs might or might not be hitting a plateau - we just don't know.

Even if it does and a new better method arises, you can be sure Nvidia will pivot accordingly - they have all the money in the world to do so. I wouldn't even be surprised if they are already working on different architectures to account for such a contigency.

Jensen is also really good at managing the company.

No matter how you look at it, Nvidia still has insane amounts of resources, led by good leadership; and will highly likely be at the forefront of the AI revolution in the near future."

2025-10-01,">You're saying the upward momentum won't be broken?

Correct.

NVDA is the elite leader of the market, and until today, had been consolidating, even threatening to break down a few times.

Barring a major collapse this afternoon, NVDA will close at a new all-time high. If it holds over the next few days, it is highly likely NASDAQ will follow.

The mainstream idea about being in a bubble and ripe for a crash is not validated by market action, which clearly shows continued accumulation and refusal to have even a 2% down day or 3% pullback, both of which are very common even in the strongest markets. To me, this means many (if not most) have missed the huge rally off the April lows and need to catch up. Hence, dips are likely to be buying opportunities."
2025-10-01,"There hasn't been a single year when bears haven't called it a bubble. Peter Schiff has been saying it since 2010. Every year I hear at least one person say they've liquidated. Bottom line is, it aint over til its over. This is a bull market."

Luckily all these “timing” trade mistakes occurred when I only have a few hundreds shares. 

Now I only sell when I need to balance my portfolio, not because i “think” it will be “down” in the next few days/weeks."
2025-10-01,All that noise over a 10 share purchase? Long term holder right?
2025-10-01,"The dip might not be until the stock is so high, your sell price is lower than the dip price."
2025-10-01,Wait for the dip donkey.    Buy high sell low
2025-10-01,"Or you can hold your Nvidia stock and watch it keep going up!

2025-10-01,Can you please post stuff like this in r/wallstreetbets? We are mostly long-term holders here. IE we are not trying to make a few dollars here and there. We are trying to grow generational wealth.
2025-10-01,Nvidia you hold forever
2025-10-05,I sold Friday. The stock will go up and at some point dip. I will buy.
2025-09-29,I’ve sold like 3-4 % of my NVDA just to take some profits and buy more SPGI with it !
2025-09-30,It's when you sell while it is tanking and then when the order is filled it starts skyrocketing up.
2025-09-30,"Same, I’m planning on selling a bunch of covered calls when we approach 200."
2025-09-29,"let me explain it in numbers.

let's say you have 100 shares at avg price of 150$. OTM CC with strike way above current price are about 50$ / week. Let's say you don't want to sell, you just want to get some ""dividends"" safe. During a week there are little chances NVDA rips through your covered calls( HOWEVER IT HAPPENS) if they are out of the money, way above.

In one year, 50 weeks on avg you make 2500$ / 100 shares + their intrinsic value. So with no price movement, let's say stock stops growing you get 16%/ year profit - your country taxes ...

if you have more shares you can do both, sell a covered call in the money, get fat premium then do cash secured put to reenter, also close to in the money. The wheel for those that have the means.

or you can just rely on reddit with the crystal ball to tell you when's the dip or the dump or the pump. Your choice"

2025-09-30,"Not necessarily. There will always be a large number of people who happen to get lucky timing the market, even if generally speaking those who don’t try timing it do better overall in the long run."
2025-09-29,Who cares how many shares you have. We are not in high school after hours weight room pump fest.
2025-09-29,lol do you want a cookie? Nobody cares how many shares you have. Nobody cares about how much money you have
2025-09-30,Lol bragging about your tiny investment ia peak trolling
2025-09-29,Shaking out the weak hands last few days . Now catch the folks who sold covered calls. Manipulation? Just buy and hold.
2025-09-29,Can't keep a good man down.
2025-09-29,"nvda rips when NO NEWS, dumps when NEWS, dumps when earnings, PUMPS when market pumps. so 50/50"
2025-09-30,Jeffries raised their price target to $220.
2025-09-30,Man NVDA has become a profitable yo-yo stock for me thru September. More powder for October. We will see!?!?!
2025-09-30,Yes more buyers than sellers.
2025-09-30,Daddy invested $100 bill into da cloud ☁️
2025-10-01,Yes more buyers than sellers. That is always the reason stocks go higher. Lower means more sellers than buyers.
2025-10-02,Oh yeah! The reading today was fascinating! Research is still the best way to learn the ebbs and flows of the Market! One thing I read was that the Chinese have been buying as many as they want of the Blackwell ultras on down there is the smuggling fee doubling the cost and still can’t keep up

2025-09-30,Followed up by a good ole dump 😊
2025-09-29,If you are invested in Nvidia technically you don’t need one (assuming you have been invested since 2015 or before)
2025-09-30,Keep holding. These are very early days like you said.
2025-09-30,Your post comes across as if you are hesitant about your investment and are trying to justify it to us/ have other people here boost your confidence.
2025-09-29,"26x forward on NVDA ain’t exactly “cheap,” it’s just priced for perfection given the AI hype. The real question is how long the supercycle runway lasts before margins start to normalize. I’d keep stacking on dips, but don’t treat it like a discount warehouse stock - it trades in a whole different league."
2025-09-29,At 26 times earnings is cheap when you consider the growth which continues and is likely to include China even as China semiconductor makers can't compete with Nvidia ecosystem involving CUDA.  No one can.
2025-09-30,Here's the truth of it. Nvidia is underpriced while Walmart and Costco are very very overvalued. It's that simple. Looks at margins and ROIC. Net income. Fcf. It's quite simple really. Everything else is overpriced while the leading tech mainly nvidia is undervalued. It will double before eoy 26. Really before that.
2025-09-29,"A lot easier to project revenues and profits for Costco and Walmart when it’s everyday shit that people buy and companies produce to sell.

This super cycle can be cut in half overnight. I know there are plans to build out these data centers that use Nvidia chips, and at some point, competition catches up or enough was built to show the ROI has peaked"
2025-09-29,Wouldn’t 260 be priced to perfection?
2025-09-29,"26x forward pe ain’t priced for perfection. The important point is the net income projection for the calculation, if that will be accurate"
2025-09-29,"I saw some disturbing AI Slop, reduced productivity from AI articles from reputable sources. This is as bad as Costco selling toxic roasted chickens."
2025-09-29,How does TSLA carry a PE of 245 with declining sales and profits. AAPL is at 35.
2025-09-29,"Ai slop ruined my business, but stock prices are carrying my business."
2025-09-29,I think a lot of people underestimate how far Optimus tech has come and what is going to happen when thats released. I know tons of consumers that dont really care about EVs but are drooling at the thought of having a robot do the dishes after mowing the lawn- and that will be peanuts compared to businesses that will use these bots for manufacturing and labor replacement. This isnt some far off 100 years in the future tech anymore.
2025-09-29,"Yeah, because it’s going to triple! I remember when aapl and msft became $1T and people all said the same then how large cap companies couldn’t double quickly.  👍 it took less than 2 yrs for msft to double to $2T btw."
2025-09-29,That goes for every investment. There's always a risk. See you in a few yrs to see where NVDA is.

2025-09-28,It literally only been 2 months since we first hit $170. Can't expect it to always be going up at every period of time.
2025-09-28,consolidation. like last year. from 800 shot to 130 then wobbled till next 2 earnings
2025-09-28,Profit booking
2025-09-29,"I held on NVDA when they were stuck at 140 for close to a year.  While it's nice to have stocks go up every day or most days, stocks don't go up for no reason.  People must think it's going higher to buy.  A catalyst.  So there has to be news that NVDA is going to make more money for the next leg  up.  NVDA is very steady at mid to high 170's.  I see this as good news as even people bail (stocks are too overpriced, AI is in a bubble), retail stock pickers buy.  Hopefully fund managers also buy.  At times, fund managers buy after a stock has run up for window dressing.  They want people to see of course they have this hot stock."
2025-09-28,"This is troll right ? If yes I’m falling for it : Consumer GPU represent less than 10% of NVDA’s revenue and it’s diminishing every year. You’re not understanding what NVDA is rn, drop the stock, it’s not for you"
2025-09-28,"Yk know nvda stock isn’t a lottery ticket that will make you rich with one news announcement. Poverty, instant gratification mindset"
2025-09-28,Priced in
2025-09-29,LMFAO. Nvidia makes 91% of revenue from datacentres. The discrete prosumer GPU is heading for extinction. They are aleady discounting the 5090.
2025-09-28,"OpenAI was in danger of running out of cash...it's not a for profit remember.  The longer OpenAi and Chat GPT remain available, the more deeply ingrained they will become in our culture.  At some point, AI will be as ubiquitous as cell phones are today.  But that was not the case 20 years ago.  I'd say it wasn't until 2012-2015 roughly that cell phones were so totally embedded in everything that they are as necessary as a car or AC in most the US.

Can you live without one?  Yeah, just like you can live without a car or AC, but it's a lot easier and nicer to have one.  And enough people feel that way that they aren't going away.  That's what AI will be sometime between 2030 and 2035."
2025-09-28,In my opinion the future of robotics with Nvidia is undervalued
2025-09-28,"
AI is in its infancy right now, and it is only begun to take roots. It is the most significant technological, life changing advancement since the introduction of the internet! Those that load their vaults with the top five most critical AI stocks now, will be tremendously rewarded 2 to 5 years from now and further!

And to address the elephant in the room for those wondering if it's too late to buy Nvidia the answer is NO it's not! Those who have the means to load up on Nvidia now and leave it in their vaults for the next few years will reap the benefits of life-changing returns! Those who fail to do so will be labeled as complete NVIDIOTS 2 to 5 years from now. Nvidia has minted more millionaires than any other stock in the history of the market!

2025-09-29,Nvidia invested $100B to pump their stock price. Nothing to do with any supposed demand.
2025-09-30,"The Open AI deal is a lease of NVDA GPUs. A lot of headwinds they are facing. Look for not the best earning report, reduced margins, reduced profits and still supply issues. And add Qwen to the mix."
2025-10-01,"It sounds like you are new to really understanding Nvidia and are just here to make a dollar. Nothing wrong with that. If this company really interests you, I encourage you to keep reading more and more about it. Come up with questions and try to answer those. 

For example, if you dig a little deeper into the 100B investment in OpenAI -  OpenAI, in return, is going to spend that 100B on Nvidia chips. They haven't disclosed the percentage of OpenAI that Nvidia now owns, but it might be a low double-digit percentage. This deal sounds amazing, although we don't have all of the details."
2025-09-28,"AI is just the latest shiny thing. 

NVDA is not an AI company. They are not a crypto company. Not a block chain, or machine vision, or robotics, or RADAR, or self driving car, or anything else company. 

They aren't even a PC video card company.

NVDA make high performance, high count, highly interconnected, embedded processors.

When there is the Next Big Thing, it will be on NVDA chips.

2025-09-28,"Hyperscalers aren't expecting ROI on thier own investments...they are looking to become MSFT in the desktop OS wars.  They have the cash to spend to continue this fight for years.  And eventually they will replace what the built last year with something that costs as much but is 10x more efficient.  And NVDA will be there to facilitate that upgrade.

Remember, NVDA is probably only getting about 30% of today's CAPEX.  Once the facilities are built and the power grid is upgraded they will start getting 60-70% of CAPEX for data facilities as the money shifts to upgrading existing infrastructure."
2025-09-28,"Yup. Keep it in your portfolio, sure, but don't look at it for another short term explosion. There are a lot of other companies and stocks out there if you're looking for short term booms and doubling stocks."
2025-09-28,You’re absolutely right but unfortunately you’re not allowed any bearish take on Nvda here
2025-09-29,Lol. Almost all stocks go to ZERO long term. The average lifespan of a Fortune 500 company is less than 20 years.
2025-09-28,"Exactly this. For a good investment return on all of the AI infrastructure built in 2023 and 2024, consumers need to spend $800B a year on AI. We are nowhere near that and let’s not forget that these chips will be outdated in 4-5 years. Are we expecting these companies to drop hundreds of billions on new chips in 5 years for the latest and greatest? I think AI will be revolutionary but it’s giving dot com where so much money is going into this with hopes of returns that may not come until much later."

2025-09-30,Not sure about the channel stuffing. But I have now switched to Qwen. This was predicted by the CEO of NVDA. We will. It be selling to China now. Could we have if Trump would not have screwed things up. Who knows. Big hit to NVDA though. They are still able to get the GPUs via Singapore. But only a small amount.

2025-09-29,TSMC 16th. Since Nvidia buys so much from them there future outlook has driven Nvidia up several times.

2025-09-27,Insiders offloaded 263 million in the 170s price range for Nvidia. But it still has great forward P/E ratio. They are a giant. Huwaie or whatever can bullshit all they want. Nvidia to the moon 🌕
2025-09-28,This is true but it isn’t the issue. In the current market there are a lot of stocks with a lot more room to run so that’s why people are moving out of Nvidia. I love Nvidia and I’ll never sell but I think for the next two years it’ll only go up to maybe 240 max. Not a bad thing ofc.
2025-09-28,"I bought in at this last stock split. I’m in for long, long term. I’m trying to wait for it to dip below $170 to buy some more, maybe $172"

2025-09-29,Institutional basically don't sell a stock like Nvidia and have to stay in with Nvidia stability and outlook. They the big fish but retail is obviously heating up and taking profits and moving into over hyped stocks much of the time. Overvalued stock took a beat down last week. See what happens this week. Im long nvda until Jenson gives the signal. Bought nvda at 3.43 and kept buying till this day. Trimming back 10% at high and buying back at lows
2025-09-30,I am investing there but I’m also not selling Nvidia to do it if you catch my drift. Space/nuclear/AI/quantum stocks mostly. NBIS is my biggest.
2025-10-01,Yup. Still make way more with that figured in. Its not hard to keep track of.
2025-09-27,When did you buy and what was cost basis
2025-09-30,"hi sorry for the late response. off my Market hour now :). 
LEAPS give you leverage. for e.g .50 delta LEAPS will give you twice the buying power as opposed to 100 shares. It gives more time to be right on your strategy as time decay is slow and on your side. let's say you are bullish on NVDA and buy $185 call expiring this week. you are taking lot of risk. if it doesn't hit $185 then your premium is gone. now take $185 call expiring Dec 19th 2025 going for $12.90/contract. besides giving you leverage, it's giving you and stock time to go up and in your favor.  and added bonus is that you can now sell CC on it to generate income. 

of course things can go south anytime but that's the basic difference. be careful with leverage, as it's double edged sword."

2025-09-29,"once robinhood releases social feature, you can follow along my trades :). 
just keep learning and experimenting with small bets. the learnings you get doesn't depend on bigger accounts. for e.g getting yourself out of ITM covered call or CSP. rolling, managing delta, handling emotions when NVDA spikes or drops. once you get handle over these, you can scale up."
2025-09-29,anytime. already up slightly overnight but pretty bullish since it held $174 really well. anything can happen but technically looking bullish. any stupid news can upset the trend though.
2025-09-30,"So do you recommend buying calls 3-4 months out? Or more like 6+ months out? 
And do you buy ITM or out of the money?

I’ve just held maybe 700 shares for a long time. Always afraid to take profit because no idea if it’s gonna just go higher. I got burned on a call once near earnings (they beat it) and the stock went no where/down. Now I’m afraid of calls.

2025-09-27,"Most importantly, Microsoft said (roughly 6-12 months back) the ROI on their cloud service has grown faster than any segment within Microsoft. If this continues to increase at the rate it currently is, data centers will be Microsoft's main cash cow (and may already be), and it will be for Google, and already is the biggest cash cow for AWS etc. 

Big tech doesn't make their own chips to replace what they buy from Nvidia. Beth Kindig stated that big tech is having to hoard all of the processors they make, because they're all in a race. She said they are unable to meet the demand for their cloud services even by using every chip they make for themselves, and buying every Nvidia GPU they can get. 

Big tech has been making their own chips for years, now, and each time a fresh learner realizes big tech made their own chips, they freak out. This is understandable. So, I'll explain a simple way to understand how this continues. 

Firstly, data centers (on average) upgrade their equipment every 1-5 years. So, let's say we didn't have over a year of backlog. Imagine the size of these data centers, how long it takes to install and fill the racks from the front to back of the facility. Stargate is going to be on over 1,000 acres of land with 4 massive data centers. To upgrade data centers of this magnitude, their GPUs are constantly being upgraded throughout each year. If they don't consistently upgrade their data centers, they'll fall behind. Also, the ROI is increased for every generation of Nvidia GPU made. This means the more big tech spends, the more they make. 

Many may wonder ""Yeah, but what are they going to do if big tech is in a phase we're they're upgrading less frequently?"". Then you have to consider the countries, and sovereign AI, and that they are constantly upgrading, too. Honestly, for me, it's more difficult to determine when this will stop. 

TLDR - Basically, think of Apple, and iPhones. The time to fear Apple crashing down is if they didn't have past/current customers upgrading to new products. Just like humans can't be without a phone, AI focused data centers can't be without GPUs, and if they get behind, and they stop upgrading, this would be catastrophic, because competition for the segment is huge, and each big tech company is trying to overpower the other.


Anyway, just like everyone will continue to upgrade their phones throughout their lives, data centers don't have an option but to indefinitely upgrade their equipment. Imagine that theoretically in Jan of each year there are people swapping out and upgrading their very back row of racks, and by December of each year they've worked their way to the front, and completed a full data center upgrade. That's very oversimplified, but that can give some idea as to how this will continue as they move forward. Even if big tech slows down how much they purchase each year, Nvidia can hike the price and maintain where they are today.

When does it all end? When will they reach enough computational power? -
The question is, is there such a thing as enough computational power for situations like these? At one point in my life I thought ""Wow... We have 100 megahertz CPUs, now, and just a couple years back all we had in the office were 25 megahertz 486s."". I was very wrong. 100 MHz was not enough. 1,000 wasn't enough, 3,000 wasn't enough, and then they started adding more threads, more cores, and it has continued. It has never stopped. Here we are decades later, and we want more GPU and CPU power in our phones, our tablets, and our computers."
2025-09-27,It doesn’t have to maintain the past margins to still be a great investment going forward.  Many believe we have just scratched the surface of what AI has to offer.  Those other companies are playing catchup.  NVDA is miles ahead of the competition.  You can tell I’m bullish.  I bought more yesterday
2025-09-27,"Shorting NVDA?

2025-09-26,"I don't think they will maintain these margins forever, that's why I see them diversifying their business aggressively lately.

2025-09-27,"It won't keep them forever, obviously, but it will way longer than people think alot of these in-house chips that everyone goes on about are chips that are used alongside nvidia chips not against them."
2025-09-27,Shorts are winning
2025-09-27,"I’m sure you know of AMD, yes? NVDA’s direct competitor in the GPU market and currently the only other company notable enough in that space. 

AMD provides a lot of great value for money products from their CPUs to their GPUs. This goes for Intel-based options too - Intel chips are generally pricier than AMD ones (at least where I’m from, lol). 

Just because you can do it for lower margins doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be ahead of the pack. AMD is still playing catch up and its been years, decades even. Meanwhile NVDA has already gone through several stock splits in recent years. 

Fyi AMD’s last stock split was in 2000. 

NVDA likely won’t print money forever, but it won’t be stopping anytime soon."
2025-09-27,They won’t. Indeed you will most likely see some slippage in the next earning report.
2025-09-27,"Don't short. 

So I agree that Nvidia is currently seeing some incredible returns.. how those margins will continue to stack up is a good question. I think that you're correct, Nvidia will likely not be able to keep 50% net margins in the coming time. However, that does not necessarily mean that would force their stock price down. Their growth right now is of course attributed to the major increase in demand of computational power, especially GPU's. My assumption is that many have already considered your point, and agree that margins will become a bit more conservative. But, that doesn't really matter if they can continue a healthy rise in revenue. If the AI/computational boom continues as analysts, investors, and Nvidia assumes/hopes, their revenue will increase by so much that a decrease in margins is likely negligible. 

Also, your point on shorting. This is a terrible, terrible mistake. The entire market is against you right now, everyone is on the AI bandwagon. Money will continue to flow, chips will continue to sell, analysts will continue to predict, and retail will continue to assume that what is good today will be good tomorrow. I actually agree (kind of) with you, though. I think that everyone knows deep in the back of their mind that the entire AI industry will experience a HUGE shedding, as with the dotcom bubble. In the long term, its here to stay, but exactly in what ways AI will and will not continue is up to anyones best guess. When this happens, Nvidia will likely lose a decent amount of value. The problem is that no one knows when this is going to happen, if it is going to happen, and how severe it is going to be. And the market will remain irrational much longer than you could remain solvent, so even if Nvidia lost some revenue as the bubble popped, no one even knows if it would effect their market cap that much.

Lastly, I do think it is fair to say competition is coming. To be honest, I don't see their biggest issue as Apple, Google, Meta, or any other company making their own chips. This business is much too risky, complex, and time consuming, and my guess is that most of these companies will either give up or build a product that is subpar (but I really don't know, maybe they will continue to push on this, I'm really not that well versed on these specialty products TBH). I see other chip makers, particularly AMD, as a real threat. I mean, look at AMD over the past decade, Lisa Su and her gang are crazy. AMD has absolutely slaughtered Intel, first embarrassing the value of their products, and then their innovation, and finally their performance. They've absolutely murdered Intel's position in the consumer space and now they've really started eating at Intel's domination of the server/enterprise space. I know many have discounted AMD and its ability to catch up, but it brought Intel to its knees at the same time it fought its own bankruptcy. Now, with money, power, connections, and a hell of a leadership team, is it really fair to discount AMD? The biggest problem for AMD and the biggest benefit for Nvidia is that even if AMD can build solutions that outpace Nvidia's, that does not mean infinite money for them. AMD's been humiliating Intel for years now and is just recently starting to pick up the pace on Intels enterprise market. With that said, I think it will be a long time before AMD is a real threat to Nvidia, but I do think its coming. Last thing, I kind of sound like an AMD shill lol, I don't own any stock or positions in either companies, but I do try to keep a close eye on the industry because I need the research for my degree.

So TLDR: Yes, their margins will likely eventually fall. Yes, they will eventually face competition. No, you should not consider shorting this stock, especially right now."

2025-09-27,"I’m not saying they won’t keep selling GPUs, I’m saying they won’t be able to do it at these margins. The profit margin isn’t sustainable, the business is. Two different concepts. Nvidia isn’t going away, they just won’t be able to make 90% gross margins."
2025-09-27,That’s my frustration. I am long and it’s a roller coaster.
2025-09-27,It’s true. No company has ever maintained margins this high. Why will they be the first? Jeff Bezos has a famous quote “your margin is my opportunity” — Nvidia is making too much money. It can’t be maintained. Someone else will step in and do it for a lower profit. Happens everytime.
2025-09-27,"“It’s up 70% since then”… that’s my experience too. Every time I take profits, it moves up."
2025-09-27,"Honestly, that might be a smart trade in hindsight a few years down the road. Every chip manufacturer eventually becomes commoditized. This could go back to a trillion dollar company and still be overpriced if the margins collapse."
2025-10-04,"CPUs have never scaled linearly with every function, either, but that hasn't stopped us from going from one megahertz, or 8 MHz to 25 MHz, and 25 MHz to 100 MHz, and the benefits have been worthwhile. When we got to 1000 MHz, I didn't think we would ever need anymore. We did. When we got to 3 GHz, I thought there was no reason that we would ever need more. We did. When we  increased threads on a single core, then went multi core and multi threaded those core, and drastically improved instruction sets, as well as reduced nanometer node size, I thought we would never need more. Here we are, with cell phones that have more powerful CPU and GPUs than computers did 10 or so years ago, and even for our simple cell phones, we still need more. It never ends. 

I had a guy arguing with me about four or five years ago, telling me that GPU's would no longer be created anymore by 2026 or so, and that they would replace desktop PCs, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo. He believed our iPhones would have GPU so good that they would be running at 8K, and even 16 K performance levels, and replace everything. His whole thing was about Apple, and he believed AMD and Nvidia would go out of business. He's a grown man, too. Actually, a physical therapist. Pretty smart guy. 

With all of the drastic software benefits we have gotten from DLSS and other artificial intelligence to boost performance, and the instruction set changes that have been made, we still need Thousands of percent more power before developers can go as wild as they want. Once we reach those thousands of percent of an increase, we will probably still need more. There will be a new software feature that demands more processing power.

The improvement of any type of processor is compounding. So, let's say Hopper was rated at a performance level of 100, and Blackwell Ultra brings a 50% increase to LLMs, and though Rubin will be on  a different node (drastically better in performance than the node Hopper/Blackwell have been on), let's say they only increase by 35%. That still comes out to a 95% compounded increase in two generations. Even if they did not hit that mark, that next generation is going to compound on the existing performance increase for LLM's. If there were no point to this, if there were a dead end, the professionals that work for these businesses and make the decisions of whether or whether or not it is profitable to purchase more, I think it is unreasonable to assume that we understand more than they do, or that we know what’s best for their business. 

With all of that said, LLM's are only one function of AI."
2025-09-27,Can you take some profits on Monday so we can have a good week 😆
2025-09-27,"\>Every chip manufacturer eventually becomes commoditized.

Ah conventional wisdom!  Ain't it grand?     Nvidia has has had these outrageously high margins for nearly 10 years, P100 in 2016.   Competitors knew that back then and thought Nvidia was ripe for disruption.  So, where are they?   Nvidia was way easier to disrupt back then than they are today.

Your question is naive because there are massive barriers to entry that a little research quickly uncovers:

\- Best high speed parallel circuit designers in the world

\- Access to a finely tuned and free ranging research organization

\- Access to the best process technology

\- Market moving force in high bandwidth memory

\- Access to the best data center architects and networking resources

\- CUDA software stack - default in the AI space.

\- Access to the best AI developers and nurturing of those relationships

\- Superior management of the entire supply chain

\- A relentless roadmap

\- A product experience that is well-optimized and just works with nearly immediate productivity 

\- Ability to deploy $Bs in design costs, generation after generation

The biggest problem is gaining momentum on the software side. 

(These are off the top, with little forethought, I'm sure there are many others.)"
2025-09-27,I need it to drop another 5% before I take more profit.. but if I could I would. I’m reinvesting in SMH and bouncing back to NVidia since they’ve so closely correlated.
2025-09-27,"The point I'm making is that it's unlikely that we see risks that Nvidia does not, and aren't prepared for. Often, people come in this sub Reddit feeling they have this idea of a possible way that Nvidia could collapse, that they are the only person that has this idea, that Nvidia isn't aware of it etc."
2025-09-27,"The Cisco event is actually an advantage to us, now. Nvidia's team are thinking of the same scenarios (and then some) as we are. 

The Cisco situation was very different. They had tons of product sitting on the shelves. Nvidia prevents this to the highest degree in case an event like what happened to Cisco were to happen to them. This is managed by signed agreements on orders before production to help deter from a similar event. Even then, it's a highly different situation. 


Cisco had P/E of 200. They sold a product that would be easily replicable and replaceable within a short period of time. Processors aren't the same. They have GPU, CPU, and DPU instruction sets tailored by the designers. This isn't the only thing that keeps businesses in the Nvidia ecosystem like consumers and Apple. 

The entire market was overbought, and people were buying anything that had to do with the ""internet"". There are safety measures to help prevent the dot com bubble in 2000, and more safety measures added after the 2008 collapse. We also have the advantage that tons more people have the ability to, and do invest in the market, now, because even back in 2000 almost everyone had to call their broker to make a sell, or purchase. It's a very different world we live in, now. It doesn't mean Nvidia can't fall, but comparing the dot com bubble is an apples to oranges situation. It was a market wide situation."
2025-09-28,What’s the point of the sub if not to discuss risks and opportunities? If you believe every company has people worrying about their top risks/opportunities then just invest and forget. The main reason people research before investing is to have an ‘edge’ over others. You get that edge when you think about things that everybody else discounts.
2025-09-27,It’s probably more like Level 3. Infrastructure that won’t be as profitable as people think.
2025-09-29,"How much has Apple's margin reduced of the years and how much have the prices of their products increase?

And it's much easier to swap an Apple for an Android phone for consumers than it is to mix a data center with different vendors.

Because there is one other aspect in the data center upgrade cycle. If you have A100, H100, GB200 and GB300 mixed in one huge data center then you want it all work to seamlessly because otherwise you actually reduce the size of your data center if only each GPU generation works for itself.

And see, this is where Nvidia's real moat is. It's called one giant GPU with CUDA and all generations supported and optimized. The old V100 today is 10x or more faster than on release primarily on SW optimization. And that will continue.

This is also why AMD will never set a foot into Stargate and no Hyperscaler will mix Nvidia DCs with their own chip DCs. These are indepdent DCs.

Jensen has stated a decade ago that Nvidia rather goes away from business than reduce margin. That's why Nvidia sells old (higher margin on old process) and no R&D chips to Nintendo and leaves the expensive R&D costs in console to AMD.

Apple has 25% unit share BUT 75% profit share in the Smartphone business. It doesn't matter if Sony and Samsung combined deliver more phones because the majority of margin in the business goes to Nvidia. So if Nvidia's unit share in AI goes to 25% while the market grows 10x and Nvidia maintaines their margins then they will make more profit then all competitors combined. This is the Apple way and Nvidia will follow that or actually has done it. Nvidia has had better gross margins with gaming GPUs than AMD has today with their whole business including DC products."
2025-09-30,"Agreed with most of your points and it is true that Apple managed to maintain its margin and in fact positioned itself in a way to stand out from the crowd however NVDA plays in a completely different market of semiconductors. NVDA GPUs are essential for training AI models and nobody comes close to their HW+SW ecosystem. But personally I believe with inference and application specific AI use cases which is the next phase, there will be a lot more players(we are already seeing evidence of that with Broadcom’s XPU) and that will definitely impact NVDAs margins. 

However, I do think with this need in the AI infrastructure cycle to upgrade to the latest generation of GPUs gives Nvidia a good runway for the near future but again there are questions of what the RoI should be and whether that is acceptable. Jensen will also move into new verticals with physical AI and so on but that is still far out and probably already priced into the stock at this point."

2025-09-30,"So here’s my question for the NVIDIA community: Are there any companies you have spotted now building infrastructure that looks boring, but could become indispensable in 10 years?

Simple answer: NVIDIA

Just check what they are doing:

Omniverse + AI simulation:  
\- Imagine making prototyping possible in ANY industry  
\- Imagine making prototyping much cheaper in many analog industries  
\- Imagine simulating the whole world for climate change  
\- Imagine training physical AIs without any dangers like in real world  
\- Foundation for full self driving systems  
\- best Digital Twin simulation

Omniverse + Cosmos + Isaac:  
\- complete Robotics & Logistics platform  
\- includes simulation  
\- includes edge HW  
\- all seamlessly connected

Clara + AI:  
\- drug discovery with AI  
\- medical healthcare solutions

DriveSim + Orin/Thor HW + Omniverse:  
\- simulating easily a trillion miles in full self driving  
\- by far the best and safest approach to reach the hard goal of >99% safety

All these products are like CUDA was in 2010-2012. They seem to be slow in progress and pick up rate is slow but it's naturally because they will lead to fundamental shifts. I expect huge revenues from them in a decade from now.

Just check from which industries Nvidia had partnerships announced in the past years and you will see that almost any industry is present. That shows you that Nvidia themselves are now building upon CUDA the next generation of applicaton frameworks for any industry.

You have to see it like this, CUDA is like the API, like Windows API and now Nvidia is working on the SW which makes companies even more productive (basically what Oracle, Autodesk, Adobe and many others provide for Windows) but not competitive to existing solutions but providing new solutions using the power of GPUs and Nvidia's ecosystem. 

Nvidia won't compete with Oracle on business SW but provide Enterprise AI solutions to enhance Oracle's solutions. Nvidia won't compete Autodesk but support Autodesk to connect to Omniverse so CAD models can be used in simulation and physical AI to check if the large plane drawn at Airbus would fly efficiently before ever building it.

This is also why Nvidia is misunderstood all the time and AMD isn't a competitor because Nvidia is more AI SW company than HW company. Nvidia thinks in solutions as a whole (HW, SW, network) and not in single segments and therefore AMD will never catch to Nvidia because there is different DNA. If you look at history then it was natural for Nvidia to go from ProViz HW (GPU) to SW (CUDA) to Network (NVLink, Mellanox) because in every step they found a new bottleneck which they tackled and they still do that. That's why Nvidia is improving switches, racks and SW across data centers. It's not to create more products but constantly improving the system because they tackle the bottlenecks."
2025-09-26,"The difference here is at the time Nvidia was a profitable company with sustainable earnings. These quantum companies are deeper in development and possibly decade long before any meaningful products. For me I don't think it makes sense to get in right now.

How will you know which will succeed?"
2025-09-30,"I have invested in Nvidia in early 2016 mainly because of their data center business. That was also around the time they started to show separate numbers or at least mention it.

To me it was clear that Nvidia will eat Intel's lunch in many HPCs applications and Jensen also already talked a lot about machine learning at that time and showed presentation showing how much better GPUs were at accelerated computing compared to CPUs.

In 2018, I stated in the AMD sub that not AMD was eating Intel's DC lunch but Nvidia was and Nvidia has grown DC revenue much faster than AMD did because in the battle of CPUs for servers, Nvidia found a way to make CPU obsoleted in accelerated computing and leave them only traditional computing which is a more saturated business."
2025-09-30,"Jensen didn't anticipate AI directly but he clearly said that ""if we build CUDA then we will find applications and market opportunities"" and he got that very right with crypto, AI and many things to come.

AI is all over the place but Jensen actually talks about accelerated computing and that was the main idea of CUDA in the first place. Nvidia has bet on that and AI is now profiting currently the most from that move.

And who hired the Stanford student using gaming hardware for parallel processing to put him into the CUDA lead team? Right, the founder with vision ;)"

2025-09-26,It just hit $180 though ….
2025-09-25,"Playing tokenized NVDA perps is cool for flexing small size and 24/7 exposure, but it ain’t the same as holding shares - no dividends, no voting, and slippage can get hairy. Great for quick scalps or hedging a crypto-heavy portfolio, but don’t confuse it with real equity ownership. If you’re testing, keep size tiny and track funding rates, that’s where a lot of the hidden cost hides."
2025-09-25,"Yeah, some exchanges are rolling them out. The one I tried was on Bitget, they partnered with OndoFinance to list tokenized US stocks as perpetual futures.   
Mechanics are just like crypto perps: USDT margin, up to 10x leverage, and trades are open 24/7."

2025-09-25,unfortunately it keeps plaguing my fyp even though im not so active on this subreddit. I'd rather drag my nutsack across 25 miles of sharp glass while getting mol*sted by a silver back gorilla on steroids than have to keep reading your bot ass posts. Jesus christ
2025-09-25,Whatttt I’ll post an update tmr bc if it doesn’t work tomorrow then theta is gonna fuck me so bad
2025-09-25,Not quite… hit my S/L and lost around 70% and then the stock immediately went up to where I would’ve had profit. If I had my SL just slightly lower I would’ve made a boatload.
2025-09-25,Well just invest then don’t gamble? maybe?
2025-09-25,Hold forever. watch it reach 225.
2025-09-25,"My tombstone will say: ""Husband, father, owned XXXX shares of NVIDIA and never sold"""
2025-09-25,Target is 335. So you tell me.
2025-09-25,"Wait for the dip, then go all in. It’s hard to bet against Nvidia’s success, considering their numerous deals and investments. I’m bullish enough to predict it hits 500 by 2030"
2025-09-25,Been holding for the last 4 years and will keep holding for another 10 to 15 years until retirement.
2025-09-25,Keep holding for another 5-10 yrs then retire off it
2025-09-25,"Just ignore the noise. Hold until YOUR sunset date then cash out. I’m holding until I have to take RMDs. Approaching that time, I’ll decide when to exit. Until then, ignore the noise and buy the dip using DCA..this company will be dominant in AI for many years because Jensen is constantly innovating and investing in derivatives that add value to the company. Geopolitics including this Administration is the primary impediment to NVidia. The demand is real and NVidia will navigate around the noise and politics. Jensen is a genius and will continue to position the company through the nonsense towards the demand. Don’t panic, just know the demand is real and will be driven by more use cases that are being developed as I’m type this post…"

2025-09-25,Should I dump Nvidia and buy a memestonk
2025-09-25,Keep holding I guess. My average is 176 so 200 isn’t really that high
2025-09-25,"I would love it if it hits 225-250, I mean 200 is nice, but I would probably sell at 200, I can’t hold forever and NVDIA is a frustrating stock."

2025-09-26,Hold
2025-09-25,"Yeah buy more. Im not currently DCA’ing but count on my bonuses to dictate when i buy. Long cash, Long Nvda"
2025-09-25,Hold for no reason. Because I like Jensen.
2025-09-25,Selling some of my 1500 shares
2025-09-25,"Since 200 is a benchmark on my exit plan after holding for a quite a while, I will sell around 15% of my Nvidia holdings at 200"
2025-09-25,Selling
2025-09-25,Cashing out about 20% to put into VOO and letting the rest ride. Sell another 10-20% at $250-300.

2025-09-25,HOLD!
2025-09-25,I got less than 100 shares so probably keep holding
2025-09-25,Buy a Ferrari.
2025-09-25,Same thing I did when it finally hit $1000 before the split. 💎🙌
2025-09-25,Taking profits :)  Not all of course....
2025-09-25,I'll wait then till it hits 225$
2025-09-25,Sell a few shares
2025-09-25,Collection fat distributions through my holdings in  *NVYY*
2025-09-26,Waiting for $300...
2025-09-26,Will probably sell half of my position
2025-09-26,"Hold; If it drops back to 150 in a market crash, so be it."
2025-09-27,"I think it should be over 200 at this point…. Is been getting a lot of bad propaganda from the media. At this point jensen can find cure of cancer with AI and the stock will drop. They just halting the stock, Wall Street aliens"
2025-09-25,I buy and sell when it back to $170

And to address the elephant in the room for those wondering if it's too late to buy Nvidia, know this... those that have the means to load up on Nvidia now and leave it in their vaults for the next few years will reap the benefits of life-changing returns! Those who fail to do so will be labeled as complete NVIDIOTS 2 to 5 years from now.

2025-09-25,"This isn't my fight, Long term long here, but I want to hear from fellow longs: 

Why not?

A lot of guys on this board appear to see themselves as big time traders.  Traders can make money on both the long and the short side.

One argument for the short side is we just tested an all time high and barely squeaked through it, then immediately retreated on what was pretty big news -- I mean the long term (\~2030) leadership is really cemented with a move like that with some analysts talking about $750B annual rev.

So explain why not being able to hold after a catalyst like that bodes well for: we're going higher."

2025-09-24,I bet on long with my entry. Good luck for u
2025-09-25,"2 days in a row shorts have profited. That is because of profit taking after a huge run and traders selling the news of the OpenAI deal. Nvidia is likely the most important stock in the world right now IMO. It is at the center of an AI revolution that will spread and influence nearly every facet of our lives. This isn’t just about LLM’s, AI is much more than that. It will change the world as we know it. I wonder what your thesis is on why you believe NVDA is a good short. Sincerely interested."

The Mag 7 earnings are increasing because they are selling hardware and services to each other at grossly inflated prices. eg Nviidia is investing hundreds of billions  in unprofitable startups to sell overpriced hardware on credit. Nobody is making any money from selling actual 'AI'. 

An old joke: 

Two economists are walking in a forest when they come across a pile of shit.

The first economist says to the other “I’ll pay you $100 to eat that pile of shit.” The second economist takes the $100 and eats the pile of shit.

They continue walking until they come across a second pile of shit. The second economist turns to the first and says “I’ll pay you $100 to eat that pile of shit.” The first economist takes the $100 and eats a pile of shit.

Walking a little more, the first economist looks at the second and says, ""You know, I gave you $100 to eat shit, then you gave me back the same $100 to eat shit. I can't help but feel like we both just ate shit for nothing.""

""That's not true"", responded the second economist. ""We increased the GDP by $200!"""

Unless you think all those GPUs and data centers mean nothing or can’t be really utilized in a meaningful way, it’s still valid since the products are meaningful to the buyer.

You’ve discovered in your infinite wisdom that what they are doing is not economically valuable, it’s all waste and will lead to nothing. They are simply passing money back and forth to “create value” yet nothing of substance will ever be produced.

You’ve found out that AI will amount to nothing, will never be useful, won’t produce profits or increase productivity, and all of these data centers were used to inflate valuations and will eventually collapse into the biggest scam ever created.

2025-09-24,"you are so wrong on no one is making money from AI, many companies are getting a good ROI now and it’s only increasing. "
2025-09-24,what has that to do with this? valuation reflects profit after earnings and paying off cost of running a company and in this case the billions Nvidia invested in whatever you call unprofitable is reflected in the cost in the end. Its really tiring reading the same lame take the last few days.
2025-09-25,"The GDP did increase, they both recieved the satisfaction of watching the other eat shit, which is arguably priceless."
2025-09-26,You did a great job with this. Billions going into thousands of data centers. That money is being directed out of other important places. But the rich are making a killing! Where will the money for a return on the billions invested come from and how long will it take?

2025-09-24,I feel like this study is bullshit. I have a small business and I utilize AI daily AND pay for it. I’m just a small fish in a very big pond. I don’t see on earth how AI is not profitable to almost any industry.
2025-09-25,The fraud is selling hardware to BS companies funded by NVDA. It is is equivalent to the No Doc loans that allowed unemployed people to buy houses before the GFC.

2025-09-24,Lol that is a good point
2025-09-24,"No.... just seem with the usa pushing China away from investing in nvda and instead pouring that money into there own chips it will probably close the gap. Along with h1b changes that will effect talent from coming to USA in the future. Then the tariffs, revenue ""sharing"", export bans etc. It's all slowing the  usa down for no reason and speeding china up if you look over decades. If the usa keeps this up they will get closer and closer, you guys could do even more stuff to shoot yourselfs in the foot. Decades is a long time. Anything can change in that long of time."

2025-09-24,Let me preface this with--I'm all in on Nvidia. A good chunk of our savings is in it. Not trying to neg bomb but watching the US economy propped up on AI speculation is scary. Don't want to end up like my parents in 08. Nvidia is literally the only single stock I own everything else is tied up in mutual funds.
2025-09-23,Stock is pretty lame in a brokerage. Roth is better so you don't sell and move into stuff thats moving. Nvda is only stock that will be down on a good day and flat on a great day. Idk

2025-09-24,Agree. So no need to panic every single time there is a price fluctuation. Just let it ride. It’s a good company.
2025-09-24,"Ya in the long run. Obviously not within the year. You probably said the same thing about Amazon, apple, etc"
2025-09-24,"I mean, hey, I was originally also gonna hold it short-term: 3\~5 years because I read articles that forecasted NVDA revenue to decline starting in '28. But ""short-term"" is nothing compared to people who move equities around every day.

Learning it was literally the most valuable company *in the world* changed my perspective fast."
2025-09-24,"Awe shit, I just put an order in for 2500 shares cuz I thought you meant this year and now I got try to cancel my order before someone in the after-hours market fills my order…"
2025-09-24,I’m bullish on the stock. All the fears when it moves down slightly is unfounded. Those folks shouldn’t be in the market if you can’t stomach that. I come to this sub for news and unfortunately just filled with a lot of nonsense usually. 
2025-09-24,"I agree.  Investors who actually own the stock have a VERY different mental state than those trading options and if they engage in margin, then that is another dimension of anxiety that drives behavior.  Sadly, they all show up in this sub so one never really knows what sort of mindset they are encountering.   Anyone who has witnessed NVDA over the past 8-10 years should have a bit more stability about them by now."
2025-09-28,If you are buying nvidia at today’s p/e and yield and you aren’t worried then you should be
2025-09-25,"NVDA investors have it easy.  Try investing in TSLA, not only dealing with EVs, and technology but an on the spectrum CEO that dabbles in politics."
2025-09-28,I will never be worried about missed gains. For me tech stocks go in the too hard pile their moats never seem concrete. I feel comfortable with my own market beating gains without buying overhyped and overpriced tech stocks
2025-09-28,"You missed out 1200% gain in nvda last 5 years.  So if you had $10k in nvda you would've now had $130,000 from that one stock ...."
2025-09-30,No but they are a lot less predictable and I don’t know what tech companies will be the front runners in years to come so yes I missed out on 1200% gains but we all miss out on gains every single day and I’m okay with that. But my point is it’s beginning to get serious overpriced as we approach an ai bubble and one day it will pop and you’ll be holding a pile of nothing
2025-09-25,"Awe 30k in a month. That’s cute. As you get older and NVDA swings your retirement by years at a time up or down. That’s a lot tougher to chew on. Stay the course. I bought in 2016 and my investment broker advise against it at the time. I can say it’s had ups and downs but long term is the game here. My $1,016 investment is well over 180k plus but does these 30-45k swings in some days and weeks."
2025-09-23,"I’m new to investment, could you please elaborate how a split from 1200 / unit to 135 / unit caused a loss of 30k a month ? Thank you"
2025-09-25,Long hold Nvda to 2030-2032 GenAI and robots are coming
2025-09-23,"So you're up 50% over a year. I'm up over 35% since 5 months ago, by not holding onto this stock. But by buying and selling dips, highs and doing the same with other stocks. Like hertz. Bought in yesterday, now it's up 5%. One day."
2025-09-26,That’s a great return. If you can hold through the swings in volatility with Nvidia (up to 15% loss in one day) you can hold any stock in any environment. It’s good practice for recessions and any economic downturn.
2025-09-23,"I was referring to the split they did basically because the price was so high they split one share into 10 bringing the price of each share down to 135. The loss in my investment had nothing to do with that but the volatile of Nvidia caused my loss. It went from 135 to 80 over a month or so. So my point was to stay invested in companies you believe in, don’t be a trader be an investor."
2025-09-26,Agreed. The autonomous driving sector is just at the very beginning of being tapped into by Nvidia as well. They see that as a multi billion dollar a year industry for them as we move closer to 2030.
2025-09-23,Okay you are looking to make a quick buck. That’s not what I’m looking for. I want to be in companies I can hold for 5-10 years.  jumping in and out of stocks is how most people lose their money. There’s the tax implications also which nobody talks about.
2025-09-24,I had 100% returns last year for short term trading the volatility. This hold forever sentiment isn't as fruitful.
2025-09-27,"I have 2 accounts, one for core holdings, long holds. The other I treat as you are doing.
Kind of like swing trading very part time but I’ve always been lucky using house money. AUG., Sept has been profitable at the tune of 45%. Thanks to TACO , NVDA and AVGO."
2025-09-27,"I been “trading” for almost 2 months now and am up up 10% atm. Dip buying (key word dip, not falling knife!) and selling (before the dips) is definitely the way to go. 

I think you chose the wrong sub to tell people that buying and holding isn’t the only way lol"
2025-09-24,Also minor compared to the extra amount that can be gained.
2025-09-27,What a weird thing to say. If you have a big tax bill it’s because you’re making income and winning.
2025-09-24,There's a difference between day trading and short term trading. I buy when i think its good and pull out to make a profit. Might take a week. Might take a year.
2025-09-28,As far as this sub goes I was actually implying that u/Affection_Age572’s response was the contrarian opinion. I mean just look at the top posts on this sub if not the majority of this thread. Yall acting like a buy and hold cult of 16yos who learned about investing for the first time
2025-09-24,Youre not making money until you sell.
2025-09-27,"Nice!
Profit is profit!!!"
2025-09-24,"Yes. But if you started with Nvidia 3 months ago, you would not be having the save results.
Everyone is talking scout ""too the moon. On our way to $200 by December"". That's a more than 10% increase by December.

Except I made 5% these last 2 days alone by not holding anything."
2025-09-27,"NVDA to me was awesome in Sept.. The ups and downs were quite predictable mostly.
Now focusing on rest of year!"
2025-09-28,Hahahah. That’s actually funny. Buy and hold Warren Buffett type advice is a “16 year old leaning about investing” that’s how you turn logic on its head. You’re telling me the 16 year old cult isn’t trying to win the lottery by trading stocks like the casino and doing option trades!?WOW! What other world views do you have?
2025-09-24,Op is down $2500 today since yesterday. And I'm up $5k since yesterday.
2025-09-23,"casino is not based on news its based on gambling

so market now is purely insider trading and no1 can do anything about it , if u know the news u timed correctly u know u got ur gains , even if this gains are unrealistic to the stock itself

thats why many expecting crash soon , when no control is there and gains are non sense , expect a fall , and thats why volatility go high when it kicks because every1 suspects its the crash there but then ah nothing still the show goes on , so the choice is yours how to handle that and when to act"
2025-09-23,"Or, just hold NVDA and other strong AI-related names long-term, and then all these short-term moves become noise.

I won't touch my long-term NVDA shares but occasionally will use NVDL as my ""casino."""
2025-09-23,Are you investing for years or for a day?
2025-09-23,"Yeah, the tape feels like a casino if you’re chasing headlines, but pros don’t trade news - we trade levels and flows. NVDA’s been a textbook case of institutions buying every dip while retail chases every PR pop. Focus on the trend, not the noise, and you’ll stop feeling like it’s all luck."
2025-09-25,It always was over the short term
2025-09-23,Turns out I am surprisingly good at that.
2025-09-23,"i reckon there's a lot of insider shit going on.  so many outrageous moves, and moves the opposite of what you'd expect.  i am definitely getting more worried.  markets at all time highs, the AI hype, the idiots in washington, Cheeto the TACO man using his clout to make billions, the rule of law in the toilet.  This is going to end badly."
2025-09-27,Literally just buying nvda and orcl
2025-09-23,You make good points.
2025-09-24,$400
2025-09-23,"It's like that circle jerk skit on the 3 Stooges where they each owed the other $20, but they each only had $10. It's funny...look it up."
2025-09-23,"U buy things, people get paid, people buy things, you get paid.

Sounds like the economy to me."
2025-09-23,Nvidia has been doing this behind our backs for a long time now. They are doing this out in the open now. What does that tell you?
2025-09-23,Still Bullish no matter what or when or how
2025-09-23,"It's not really that strange when you realize there's other actors in the mix.

The negative sign in math was invented to signify debt btw. Before that people thought it was a nonexistent concept."
2025-09-24,Yet im up 42k im my modest investment. Who gives a flying F
2025-09-24,"Not if there’s 0 value created.

Then it’s just a debt “shell game” played by colluding parties to put debt on the books so as to minimize tax liability.

Generally, the point of a legitimate economy is to create value as opposed to creating a debt circle jerk.  

Creating value lifts all boats, playing a debt “shell game” benefits only the small number of participants in the circle jerk.  

The point is not to collude with other participants in a circle of debt to presumably offset tax liability.   The point is to legitimately create value, sell products and services to customers."
2025-09-23,No. It's like two neighbours charging $50 to mow the other's lawn. Money exchanged but no value created.
2025-09-23,The value created is that both of the lawns are mowed? I fail to see how no value was created?
2025-09-23,"its new economy , if you fail to see it too bad. they dont spend money for fun."
2025-09-24,"Define value,  they have made me 42k in stock the last 2 years."
2025-09-28,But their lawns are both mode there's the value created.
2025-09-23,"Oh, there's money to be made over there, especially if you bought otm calls.  Sell the news!"
2025-09-23,Don’t trade NVDA.  But and hold long-term.
2025-09-23,Floki is good cheap now
2025-09-24,"Red as Fuck today.

2025-09-23,That was short lived
2025-09-22,over for shorts….
2025-09-23,My cost average is $35.34. Not selling any.
2025-09-22,Why do these types of people exist and how long have they been in the market and held onto stocks?
2025-09-22,Oh my God relax. I will remind you again that what separates a good investor from a bad investor is patience… By the dips
2025-09-23,Haha didn't see the news today???
2025-09-22,WOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAH BUDDY TIME TO BUY MORE
2025-09-23,"Oh what a tragic mistake I made 2 weeks ago when it dipped down to 165, and like a fool, I bought another 250k worth of shares! I've been in Nvidia 2 years now, have retired early as a result, and based on the quality of life that I lead and I'm comfortable with, looks like I will likely die before I am able to spend the money I have earned with Nvidia! I never imagined it was possible to laugh all the way to the bank so many times.

I find such entertainment in these Doom and Gloom posts, as well as watching all the comments by the amateurs and unknowing that have no clue what Nvidia has done, what it's in the process of doing, and what it will do in the future. As I have stated many times before, Nvidia is not a stock that you trade it is a stock that you own and hold, otherwise known as an investment! 

Sir Warren Buffett - "" the stock market is a mechanism used to transfer money from the Impatient to the Patient"""
2025-09-22,Sell me your shares at this low price
2025-09-22,Well because what you invest in Nvidia can be better deployed so they are annoyed because Nvidia sat out the run up this past month.

2025-09-23,"Ummm, did these people not see the market since the announcement of $100 billion?!"
2025-09-24,Idk how long you’ve been around but since 2012 it’s been a mistake to sell.
2025-09-25,Sell!!!
2025-09-23,"I’m tired of stupid posts like this. If you can’t handle excessive volatility, get out of single stocks."
2025-09-24,Have you no clue how investors trim profits after an all time high? Educate yourself or stop investing and go back to the casino.
2025-09-23,"for real. oh wait its 5 minutes later and its up 10%. I say it all the time. buy, hold, buy the dips. im hoping to increase my stake when it goes down again!"
2025-09-23,🤣 Yesterday was very profitable!
2025-09-23,"It's amazing how many NVIDIOTS are out there that buy into every analyst story, Motley Fool and Jim Cramer nonsense! But hey, the market needs a fair share of losers to create opportunity for the winners!"
2025-09-22,Pushing down the stock do they can buy.
2025-09-22,It’s up 86% since April 3rd. So they are trying to get it down to so they can buy more.

2025-09-26,"What is wrong with you? A 5 dollar swing is nearly 3%. You dont understand me, and in no world can random individuals cause a 5 dollar swing. 
1. Once again (because you cant read): 90% volume a day is traded by institutions, meaning individuals have no pricing power
2. A 5 dollar swing is a gigantic move, the fact that you use it as an example is laughable, you’d need to buy millions (5-20m) of shares at the same time and fill all institutions orders to make it happen, and institutions would roll it back in seconds/minutes (90% liquidity). What person on reddit - who watches the posts and actually believes them and thus sells his shares solely based on this reddit post - has billions investmented in nvidia?"

YouTube sold for $1.6B 
EBay bought Paypal

You sent smarter than the market. The market pivots and shifts and new tech emerges. Bitcoin is going to a million or zero. 

Don’t think you are smarter than the market or valuations. You aren’t."
2025-09-22,"When you were down 67%, NVDA had a better valuation relative to fundamentals. So it justified holding it. 


If NVDA was to gap down 50% tomorrow, unless it was for some insane reason, I'd be buying as much as I possibly could. Because then it would be great value.


It's so simple but people just seem to be allergic to common sense"
2025-09-22,"I mean literally a 10 year old child is 'smarter than these valuations', the tech stocks are so overvalued right now you'd have to be an idiot to expect that momentum to continue long term


Here's an idea, hopefully it's not too complicated for you: When a business is undervalued with strong fundamentals, you buy it. When it is overvalued relative to those same fundamentals, you sell it. You really don't need to be a genius to do that and over the long term, IT WORKS.


Don't believe me? Just look at the most notoriously successful investors over the long term (Buffett / Munger if you want a mainstream example). They all do exactly that"
2025-09-22,"There are such things as value traps, they are cheap and stay cheap forever. They don’t grow earnings or revenues or scale. 
Western Union’s p/e is 3, declining for a decade, is that a value stock? Or decaying business model? 

There are momentum stocks in fast rising industries that can run on overvaluation for decades, like the recent 20-25 year tech bull run. 

Buffett’s style is impressive, but he has the gift of longevity and patience, He never owned companies like Microsoft, Amazon, google and now NVDA - not sure of those are mistakes or not. Buffett also famously criticized Amazon‘s evaluation in 1999 comparing it to Sears.  Blockbuster once laughed at Netflix.

Companies like Coinbase, RobinHood, PayPal, and some second layer crypto companies are trying to re-create the financial system, introduce blockchain & tokenization.  You cannot effectively value these things. They are speculative high risk with really high potential returns.

Is Bitcoin fair valued? Does anyone know what it is?

If you wanna make 6 to 8% a year for 30 years, you are far better off at the S&P 500 index 

If you want a home run, you have to buy speculative. high momentum stuff, or tech"

2025-09-20,"Solid move by NVDA, but folks gotta remember these AI/autonomous bets take years to pay off. The real driver for the stock short term is still datacenter + GPU demand. Cool headline, but don’t let it distract you from watching earnings and margins."

2025-09-19,"NBIS looks like it has exploded and YTD it’s up 240% however don’t let that fool you.  They are on a massive hyper growth trajectory. Lots of partnerships literally new names daily praising 

NBIS https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nebius_introducing-isaac-01-the-first-open-source-activity-7374543282149961728-OPlP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAAFnoAzsBzOX0eBgHvu7zjrDjT1jr7RcA6mg

They are growing their autonomous vehicle fleet VIA Avride leg of the company. 112 bots on a single campus +80,000 deliveries with a $5 average revenue for a total of 400,000 in revenue with a sticker price of 6,000 per bot that 672,000 dollar investment and this revenue is from a single semester of school.  The food delivery model offers an easy opportunity to grab a solid 10-20% of all US uber eats and grub hub deliveries for a potential of 2-5 billion annually.  That’s not bad for bots that are generating fully paid off investments in under 6 months of service.  

The additional GPU for rental just signed the first of many large contracts with hyperscaler MSFT.  The analytics haven’t even fully figured out the current value for the company because they are firing on all cylinders and running in several directions. 

Jeff Bezos personal investment account Bezos Expeditions invested 72 million into Toloka a trading tool for AI robotics. This sector was exempted from the last earnings report but with so many recent corporate praises there will soon be multiple announcements. 

NBIS also owns a 28% stake in Clickhouse which is valued recently around 6.35 billion but they are also hypergrowth and some speculation on a 2026 IPO that would probably argue 10-15 billion in value….but currently the investment is just shy of 2 billion.  

They are partnering with what seems like every start up AI company that catching fire.  And ALL of them praise NBIS for how they helped them and made the creation process so much easier or how they fine tuned their GPU’s and offered a cloud support that allows them to have +10X speeds.  The pharma companies have praised NBIS and education companies such as Stevens have partnerships to build the new age of interactive smart learning tools.  

They were the number one download on Huggingface which is a code training tool used across the industries for software training.  They have been massive praised on every facet of their business and products. 

I think that not having this in a portfolio is one of the biggest misses of the decade if people simply wait and watch it fly off into the sunset. 

The upside is comparable to investing in MSFT back in 1999.   This seems like a wild imagination but they are on that kind of a global mission.  Amazing leadership, just landed a 17.4-19.6 billion dollar contract, partnering with almost everyone, and it’s hard to find a negative comment about the company.  

Add this and you’ll be super happy later."
2025-09-19,"Nobody fucking knows. That's why they index. Over the long term just index + hold already great companies.

Everything else is just a gamble. You hold a random hot AI/robotic possibly watch it go -50% while the index rises +15% over the same period. But you also get rewarded for the risk if it goes up +300%. Is this a good way to build wealth? I don't think so."

2025-09-19,Jensen never does anything that isn’t aligned with the best long term interests of NVidia. He knows that the future of the supply chain must move to domestic production. TMSC is a strategic risk to the supply chain. The Orange moron will not stop China when it invades Taiwan so Jensen must incrementally begin the shift to production domestically.
2025-09-20,"Right? I basically stopped putting money into NVDA. I haven’t pulled out my investments, but if it’s gonna stay flat, there are other avenues for growth."
2025-09-19,Anticompetitive law. Nvidia already is basically a monopoly. Same reason why Lina Khan blocked them from buying ARM
2025-09-19,"Yeah I see that!!!
I mean I’d rather rent a Lambo for the experience only. Wouldn’t buy one though."
2025-09-19,Bro deleted his reddit account. Wouldn’t be surprised if he sold early
2025-09-19,TBF it's two different plays. One is NVDA for life because you believe in the company. Intel is a Risk to reward play. @ $21-23 a share you'd looking at a 300% gain compared to 50-100% for NVDA bull case.
2025-09-20,Maybe so. I’m just looking to short whatever company the administration decided to acquire next. (Lockheed Martin?)

2025-09-19,Nana broke even. That's the power of holding long-term.
2025-09-18,I am not surprised.  Nvidia has been trying to get its hands on a general purpose chip.  It tried to buy ARM but the SEC didn't a approve the deal.  Rumor has it Nvidia actually got Linux to run on their GPU with some virtual machine magic.  They've been trying to get this piece of the puzzle for ages.  I am curious what is Jensen's master plan.  Maybe control everything from top to bottom???
2025-09-19,"Soooo…I was on the fence with Intel. Now NVDA pulling this move “kinda cool” , I’m leaning into purchasing some Intel. Still a good time? Pure play for Intel for now? I mean it will take time for Intel to gain more traction through NVDA ,  I’m thinking a year or so?

2025-09-22,A lot of headwinds and more mounting each passing day. Still a great company. They may have to wait for the orange man to leave office for some things to get better. They just gave a 15% bribe to him. Manufacturing bottlenecks are not improving at all. If you really parse their last earning report they lay it on the line. But some get so hyped about going to the moon they do not bother to read. Never forget….backlog does not produce profit. I just hope they are developing quantum. If not they will soon be passed up. Foxcom is not going to build more capacity….why would they. They are it the cat birds seat and can improve their margins with all the demand. I am a buyer and a holder. But it is not going to be a rocket ship ride. The next earning report is not going to be pretty.
2025-09-18,Not bad for the largest company in the market. More stability with decent upside
2025-09-19,"Yep, it’s a huge deal that China won’t be buying any more NVDA, good potential revenue for AMD"

2025-09-17,"It’s astonishing how consistently Trump misreads the tech industry. His online presence alone reveals a fundamental disconnect in his understanding of how innovation actually works. Instead of letting the market ride its natural momentum, especially in AI and infrastructure, he inserts himself into the narrative, claiming credit for his ill placed ""America First"" agenda while disrupting the very forces driving growth in the AI sector.

Rather than fostering long-term stability, his approach is rooted in performative bravado. The tech sector thrives on strategic patience, not impulsive interference. But Trump’s need to dominate the spotlight turns what could have been a clean economic upswing into a muddied spectacle of self-promotion.

He didn’t need to reinvent the wheel, just let it roll. Instead, he’s reaching into the pot and stirring the soup turning it to sludge."

2025-09-18,"I might be wrong, but wasn't this ""not selling chips to China"" part of Biden policy, and it's just exasperated under Trump with the whole tariff ordeal. But Trump has a willingness to make a deal to sell, whereas Biden didn't."
2025-09-18,Yes you are correct at the Biden administration did attempt to block Nvidia from selling ships to China for security reasons. But the difference between Biden and Trump is that Trump is trying to take a bite out of nvidia's profits with this 15% racketeering and tariff charges while the Biden administration encouraged NVDA and other chip makers to invest in U.S. manufacturing by offering significant subsidies and a 25% tax credit. 
2025-09-17,Not an issue. Record earnings last quarter and will be another record this quarter. All with no China.
2025-09-17,"China blocking those RTX Pro 6000D orders is more headline risk than actual revenue hit for NVDA, since their China exposure has already been trimmed post-H20 restrictions. SMIC making progress is notable, but they’re still years behind TSMC’s bleeding edge. Near-term, this just reinforces Nvidia’s moat in AI chips outside China."
2025-09-18,Ehh. September is always a bad month for stocks. I wouldn’t worry.
2025-09-17,Non existent as China only told not to buy from offical channels. Which companies never did anyways

2025-09-17,"It shouldn't be that big of a deal in terms of revenue, but considering that wall st had China sales priced into the stock price already, it might go down pretty bad maybe back to $160/150."

2025-09-17,I meant forget about the revenue from China.
2025-09-17,"LOL. Chinese owned shell companies  based in Singapore bought $33B worth of Nvidia hardware in the last quarter. On top of the $19B sold directly to China. 

China also has large industry illicitly converting gaming cards to high performance server cards. The remove the GPU and transfer it to a custom motherboard with much more RAM and add a blower fan.  

Everybody knows that China is buying huge amounts of sanctioned Nvidia chips via third countries (mostly Taiwan and Singapore)  But nobody wants to rock the boat. \[Just like Russia is selling sanctioned oil to the EU via India.\]"

2025-09-17,In my opinion China buys the top NVDA GPU's though the black market. They got no interest in the H20 or any other dumbed down GPU
2025-09-18,"Black market,or steal a high end chip and reverse engineer they have done it to apple Tesla and wherever they can get ahold of a high end chip"

2025-09-17,Great trade! My only comment is not to hold all of them lots until expiry but take profit as you go along. Have a target in mind and sell in small quantities. You've 100 lots so quantity shouldn't be a concern. Just a suggestion 🤷
2025-09-17,"Wait, how does this work. Your call option is above current strike price. So you are in the money because your option allows to get nvidia cheaper?"

2025-09-17,"I would second this advice. You could make a killing if you sell some on big profit days, even if it never makes it to $218."
2025-09-17,"Well, technically it's not ""cheaper"". There's the option premium to be considered. The breakeven price on this trade is when NVDA hits 218 (170 strike + 48 call premium).
However, this is a great trade as lots of extrinsic value so as the stock goes up this option goes up even more than just holding the shares themselves.

If OP holds until expiry the net cost basis of these shares if assigned will be 218."
2025-09-17,I just tied all my $ up in my first Nvidia CSP's. 10/17 165's. It's all an experiment in finding plays where I don't get f'd for a change. I'll be watching your play - fingers crossed for ya!
2025-09-19,"It's about market cap, upside potential, not really about what ""you think so"", but good luck homie"
2025-09-19,"I have leaps on everything I recommend, but you self admittedly are a degen gambler so all I can say is good luck. Not really a risky play at all too, betting on nvda going up *at all* in 1+ years time is a no brainer but all I said is there are better bets on such a general bet right now. You can stop frothing at the mouth now, G"
2025-09-19,hahaha put the ss u paper trader. Your probably just a bag holder

2025-09-16,"QQQ and SPY will always be winners long term. 

I would probably allocate 75% of that money to those index funds and play with the other 25% (Buy NVDA, sell covered calls for example)

Full disclosure my portfolio is 100% NVDA (~830k) and I’m selling covered calls weekly."
2025-09-16,"I’d defs diversify some of your investments, like don’t get me wrong I’m pro Nvidia have a small amount of shares and still plan to add more, but get some other investments, gold is pretty good atm. (Not investing advice, just remember GPt can be cray cray)"
2025-09-16,Maybe check out QQQ? Definitely diversify some. I recommend a few different sectors.
2025-09-16,"I’d invest half in NVDA and half in gold. Dont get me wrong, I’m very confident in NVDA and I hold ~2500 shares. But I’m also worried about the macro, and gold always worked for me as a counterweight."
2025-09-17,The dip the last couple of weeks is a great opportunity to buy.
2025-09-17,Don’t listen to Reddit that is the best advice!
2025-09-17,Buy big on growth stocks
2025-09-22,You’re a rookie with investing and you’re seeking advice on Reddit?  You should seek professional advice. But I do own and like NVDA.
2025-09-16,"Start by selling layered puts (ask ChatGPT about it). Stagger them out over the next year. Also buy an entry position. This will result in a combination of things. First, you’ll have some exposure in case the stock jumps in addition to gains in the premium. Second, if the stock dips you’ll minimize your loses while ensuring a lower average cost. It takes advantage of time value of money as well as DCA. That’s my advice at least"
2025-09-17,"I’m
Planning on doing this as well. I got around 1.5 million of nvda shares"
2025-09-17,Not sure anyone will get rich buying SPY.
2025-09-16,I’m from AUS though so I have to factor in currency .. any advice on that?
2025-09-18,Everyone says something different. The only consistent thing is invest in sp500
2025-09-17,When it trades sideways the whole week and I have one green day to sell calls it’s usually about 6-8k.
2025-09-17,"There’s a difference between investing and day trading/gambling my friend. 

Everyone has different risk tolerances depending on where they’re at age wise and their financial profile. 

As I disclosed I’m 100% allocated to NVDA because I’m a bit of a degen but I have a lot of runway in front of me."
2025-09-16,"First off, I wouldn’t rely on ChatGPT for stock trading advice. It can provide some useful information, but it’s not reliable for predictions. Personally, I believe Nvidia still has plenty of room to run. That said, I wouldn’t put that much money into a single stock—unless it’s only a small portion of your overall net worth. Anything unexpected could happen and the stock could tank. If you’re really confident, maybe put around 40% into Nvidia, but make sure to diversify the rest across other holdings."
2025-09-17,Cool thanks. I was thinking of doing something similar for my shares I can probably gross 15-20k a week if the calls expire worthless
2025-09-17,If you lose your shares do you sell puts on your cash to get back in ?
2025-09-17,"I pray for a big red day to get back in below my last average cost. 

If that doesn’t happen you have to capitulate and buy back in higher and have less shares. 

Not ideal but it’s part of the game. 

I don’t sell CSPs"
2025-09-19,"These ""neoclouds"", CRWV and NBIS both have massive contracts. CoreWeave with OpenAI and Nebius with Microsoft. I truly believe this is just the start for partnerships. I chose to invest in Nebius over CoreWeave for the fact that OpenAI is eventually going to start building their own data centers, but Nebius also owns Avride, TripleTen, Toloka, and ClickHouse for additional revenue. On top of that, they're looking to expand up to 1GW by 2026."
2025-09-16,Is Nvidia ever compared to IBM and its growth during 80's? I'd be interested to see from a % of market comparison how they compare.
2025-09-17,I recently invested in Applied Digital.  APLD.    I’m actually surprised I’m doing so well.   I’d invest more if I could.
2025-09-19,"Thanks for this, plus they got a bigger contract from Microsoft compared to coreweave, but nvda owns a portion of coreweave"
2025-09-19,"You can't go wrong with either one. I just look at it this way. CRWV currently trades at a P/S ratio of 12-15x. After the Microsoft deal, NBIS is looking at a minimal annual income of 4-6 billion. If the share price of NBIS remains in the 90's, that would mean NBIS is only trading at a P/S ratio of 4-6x which is BIZARRE. If NBIS traded at a P/S ratio of 15x, and the outstanding shares remained around 250 million, you're looking at $360/share."
2025-09-16,Red day again.
2025-09-16,"That revenue jump is insane - NVDA basically turned data centers into an AI toll booth. The question now is sustainability once hyperscalers slow capex or competition finally ramps. Great ride so far, but chasing at these levels means you better have strong risk mgmt in place."
2025-09-16,"Not a bad move, man - QQQ is basically a basket of the big tech names, so you’re riding the same wave as NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, etc. At 18, you’ve got time on your side, so even a small bag like $200 is a solid way to get skin in the game and learn. Just keep stacking slowly and don’t trip over the short-term noise."
2025-09-17,"Some other good funds are GDE, SPMO. But congrats man, its a great choice regardless."
2025-09-16,Average Nvidia Retail Investor with 53 shares be like:
2025-09-16,Every day I open reddit hoping to see a new post from this guy
2025-09-16,Been red most of the night.
2025-09-16,I’ll be holding my 21 shares
2025-09-16,Annnnd we are red
2025-09-16,I’m holding on w my 2200 shares for 5 years.. to the 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2025-09-17,"How's the green futes looking today, Dumbass"
2025-09-17,Dumbass bagholder
2025-09-16,"Don't worry everyone, I'm holding strong on my 7. I promise I won't flood the market by selling any off."
2025-09-16,"Average has 2 shares, if that..."
2025-09-16,"Thats what they want you to see, so you'll sell..."
2025-09-17,You're just jealous that I have $275 million and you have $5000 ....
2025-09-17,Looking great!  I'm in since $14 a share!  Green for miles dude.  Too bad you missed out .....
2025-09-16,lol ok bud!!  Do you have $275 million?? .....  I thought not ....!!
2025-09-17,"I'm in since $14 a share years ago.  How am I a bagholder? ....   You are though, I bet .... ahahhahhahhaaaa"
2025-09-16,Sell off for rate cuts
2025-09-17,"Another senseless Nvidia post by amateurs that know absolutely nothing about the future of Nvidia, what it has done, what it's doing, and what it will do in the next coming years. Smart people are loading their vaults with Nvidia right now and will reap tremendous rewards over the next two to three years.

Nvidia has minted more millionaires than any other stock in the history of the stock market. It's not stopping anytime soon as the leaders in the most relevant technological revolution since the introduction of the internet! Those that hesitate will masturbate, while those who are wise and patient will celebrate. Nvidia is not a stock that you trade it is a stock that you buy and you own otherwise known as an investment

Sir Warren Buffett.....""Getting wealthy in the stock market is not about timing the market,it's about time IN the market.""

""The stock market is a mechanism used to transfer money from the impatient to the patient""."
2025-09-17,"Big deal.
That's barely a 10% increase over the next 3 months. You can make way better returns than that, buying and selling the dips."
2025-09-18,All that bullshit because u like a picture
2025-09-17,"That's a 14% return in 10 weeks, that's not bad at all.."
2025-09-17,"No. Thats 14% in 15 weeks.
That's a percent a week.
I made 5% last week alone , by not holding."
2025-09-17,"December 1st.. thats 10½ weeks from today...

It's a nonsensical post, but taking it at face value - if the stock hits $200 by Dec 1st that would be a great return over that stretch, even if it isn't the absolute best you could get (elsewhere)..."
2025-09-18,Rising as we speak...
2025-09-16,Have you seen Oracle’s guidance?? The only way that happens is if NVIDIA keeps selling.
2025-09-16,"Shovels don’t stop selling till demand for the gold fades—AI buildout still has legs into ’25 at least. NVDA/AMD got runway, but watch margins once hyperscalers start squeezing suppliers. Staying long makes sense, just don’t sleep on rotation risk when rates shift."
2025-09-16,Buy mining companies instead CRWV and NBIS
2025-09-16,"Next year the current generation of ""Shovels"" will be obsolete and everyone will have to spend all the money they spent on nvidia all over again. 

So all the money they just made in the last few years will come in all over again. The 60 billion in buybacks? Probably 80 or 100 billion next year or even next quarter on top of that."
2025-09-17,"Gpus have a limited service life though….  far shorter than that of  shovels.  Gpus are highly profitable in data centers and we’ll be regularly upgraded.   Their breakeven time is 18-24 months for an H100 and these both require a lot power and rack space for a given performance measure.  So, H100s will be removed from service and replaced with Blackwells for power and resource reasons.   This cycle will continue until maturity.

The H100s leaving their first service will go to countries with power and space to spare to continue their life for another few years.   Separately, The market will face a glut of used cheap second hand gpus soon and no export controls will stop their being sent to china, Russia, etc."
2025-09-16,Who is buying oracle at this price
2025-09-16,"Ironically GDX (the gold miner ETF) has more than tripled NVDA's year to date return, but all you idiots have your head stuck too far up your ass to even realize what's happening


Let's see how 'selling shovels' works out when all those AI companies start realizing they've been chasing an unprofitable pipe dream and are way, way over-capitalized


Go ahead, wait a year with your stupid massively overvalued tech stocks, see what happens. Come back to this comment. Prove me wrong"
2025-09-16,And TSMC is selling the shovel material to nvidia
2025-09-16,The line for shovels is a lot longer than that
2025-09-16,You guys want a great little Jem check out STEX crypto currency backed by gold bullion it could and well possibly the next best thing if you get in early!!
2025-09-17,google sells itself shovels.
2025-09-17,Freak the fuck out and SELL EVERYTHING!!!
2025-09-17,Everyone makes money eventually. Even investors.
2025-09-17,Can't make shovels without materials. Buy Broadcom too.
2025-09-16,"This is a bad take. Amazon and google especially will grow their cloud services and infrastructure by huge margins while machine learning costs will come down with effiency improvements bringing down inference costs.

Overall I would say NVIDIA is arguably a bigger question mark for the long term if AMD can catch up. (Not the company itself but the stock)

As for Meta, i don’t know their business enough but it does feel like it will not benefit nearly as much as the others from AI and will keep relying on AD revenue"
2025-09-17,"Yes, if NVDA is selling shovels, GOOG is selling the maps on where to dig."
2025-09-16,"Oracle is pumping right now. Buy stocks of companies that are in the play to buy TT. Meta, google, oracle, amazon, microsoft."
2025-09-17,Is oracle good to buy? Looking to diversify my portfolio
2025-09-17,"Of all the things that's not gonna happen, Oracle's revenue projection is not going to happen the most."
2025-09-16,"Hyperscalers aren’t doing volume on ASICs, Nvidia demand is still outstripping supply despite all of the FUD out there. So I’m not too worried about competition. I’m more concerned with longer term demand and power grid constraints."
2025-09-17,Google also selling maps to everyone on where to dig. Literally w google Maps.
2025-09-16,"I hope no one, still over priced"
2025-09-17, Bro no buy actual physical gold shares your crypto is not fdic insured or even regulated “gold backed” lol lies
2025-09-16,Then buy TSLA to short it. 💁🏻‍♂️
2025-09-15,"Just a slight correction - ""it's"" means ""it is"".  The possessive form of ""it"" is ""its"".

Meanwhile, I'm holding and hoping you're right!"
2025-09-17,Just ignore them and remain convicted. Op will likely panic sell during the next dip
2025-09-19,Some cool stuff probably at NVIDIA GTC October 27-29 Washington DC… I hear NVIDIA is helping out Intel now.
2025-09-15,"250 PE with zero earnings growth in 2 year.

VS

50 PE growing 50%  every year."
2025-09-15,Reddit and OPEN was the best choice of 2025 in my portfolio.  Invidia been a solid choice but I think I kinda missed the train in 2023
2025-09-15,"Bro what?

NVDA has done the most insane run up since the 22nd of April this year. 

Up 60% ! ! 

Now you regards come crying for -2.74 % on average for the past MONTH? 

And for Tesla, that stock changes anytime Musk tweets or does anything. Most unstable sh1t ever. But go ahead and move your entire portfolio to Tesla. See how that will work out hahahahaha"
2025-09-15,Thinking of loading up on nvdl.  Warning to anyone holding the stock.
2025-09-16,Moved my entire Tesla position (10%) to Nvidia in May 2024. Been buying the dips since and will be buying all future dips. Avg price $115. Best investment decision I ever made.
2025-09-15,"one is a scam, the other has made more profit in one year, than the entire existence of tesla."
2025-09-15,This is why it's better to just buy VGT or QQQM .....  Thank me in 10 years
2025-09-15,i have both so feels good either way
2025-09-15,When did Nvidia start the share buyback?
2025-09-19,Shut up and just buy both and touch some grass I feel some of you sit on Reddit all day just buy hold and shut up thank you
2025-09-16,You guys want a great little Jem check out STEX crypto currency backed by gold bullion it could and well possibly the next best thing if you get in early!!
2025-09-19,Heavy on $LENZ for 2026
2025-09-20,MVIS holders happy!!
2025-09-28,Tesla is earning more politically than being a good product company.
2025-10-01,NVDA to 225$
2025-09-16,Nbis and crwv holders hard chillin rn
2025-09-15,"I had a fair chunk of NVDA in 2022/3. Avg price I think about $28. 

Unfortunately live dealt me a few lemons so had to sell everything. But it got me through a difficult period and even tho my average price is now $110, it’s not an awful place to be"
2025-09-15,The train was much better when I bought in 2016 and held now have an average share price of .84 per
2025-09-16,I use Reddit a lot.  And just becasue id that I owned it for a year and then after it went down I sold.  Immediately following that it skyrocketed up.  Why did it go up?
2025-09-15,"A great recipe for failure in stocks… Is buying them when they’re high… Like Tesla is now and selling them when they are low or having a small dip like Nvidia just had

The thing that separates a good investor from a bad investor is patience"
2025-09-15,I liquidated when we hit $180 the second time and did just this. There is to much political fuckery going on with this company in particular. I still believe in NVDA. Just don’t have the stomach for the ride. I’ll capture most of the gains in VGT with lower beta. 
2025-09-15,"they haven't, they said they had authorized the buyback to happen to do it but it's up to them to decide when to actually do it"
2025-09-15,I only bought Reddit bc I saw FB go public and never bought in back in 2013
2025-09-16,Was buying stuff for the arrival of the second kid 😭
2025-09-16,It went down after a change to Google search engine started driving less traffic to Reddit. It went back up after their last earnings where everyone learned that didn’t matter
2025-09-16,"They just haven't sold any robots....The best news for Tsla is that musk is buying more stock and trump says corporations shouldn't have to report earnings quarterly....omg, what a mess trump can be."
2025-09-16,Yes. TSLA sells gold rushes and NVIDIA sells shovels and strainers.
2025-09-17,yeah thats why u just buy the VOO and QQQ .. why would u waste time picking loads of stocks individually?
2025-09-16,"huh? it's a day trading stock. 

holding NVDL is only extra risk."
2025-09-16,People have been holding fngu and tqqq for 8+ years. 2x isn't a big deal. It'll move up and down 50+% but if one is fine with that then it really doesn't matter.
2025-09-16,"Aa others stated - it's not just day trading, it's excellent in a Bull Market / growth environment.. which was NVDA from Mid April until about a month ago."
2025-09-16,Doesn’t have to be a day trader.  It’s also like borrowing money. So 10k in nvda is like 5k in nvdl.  Yes the longer you hold depending on swings can eat you alive.  But I had Tesla in March as a leverage and still sold at a profit after I was down 40%
2025-09-15,This is a bullashit article that suggests that h20 getting banned and this antitrust investigation being related. Trying to project all these are latest developments. Will request mods/op to take this down
2025-09-15,When did Nvidia start the share buyback?
2025-09-15,You can take the Article down all over Reddit but it already affected the stock price
2025-09-15,Just a  way to temporarily drop the stock. This is old news just brought back up.
2025-09-16,Share prices slipped so it did
2025-09-15,This report astounds me. What AI did you use to get it if you don’t mind sharing?
2025-09-15,"China’s not gonna just roll over that easy, man. They’ve been stockpiling semis and pouring billions into their own fabs—sure, NVDA’s tech is still miles ahead, but don’t sleep on long-term competition. Short term, NVDA stays king, but geopolitics can flip the script quick."
2025-09-15,"If any country can catch up… it will be China. They cut all red tape and are the manufacturing center of the world. If it takes the USA 5 years, it will take them 1."
2025-09-16,"Most replies here are clueless - ya china is in trouble, and wont be able to compete compute wise, unless they make some deal with the us government to get some version of nvidia chips as a stop gap until they can create their own, though they arent close despite what the china bots are saying. Jensens says their close to flatter their massive egos, but reality is no nvidia stack, cuda dependance, no tsm, asml, HBM, they are cooked in the short term."
2025-09-16,First let it dip 20% so I can buy cheap calls kthx
2025-09-15,"Pride comes before the fall, this extreme hubris will not serve you well in investing."
2025-09-16,"If you think China hasn’t been buying chipsets through other countries, you should level up your skills in international trades and have another look at NVDA last quarterly earnings. 

Giving you a hint. Look at Singapore and how much revenue it represents for NVDA in the latest Q earning. 🧠"
2025-09-15,"China wont let this go easy. dont compare Xi to Trump. one is a leader( good or bad), another is a clown"
2025-09-15,[https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/15/business/china-nvidia-investigation-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/15/business/china-nvidia-investigation-intl)
2025-09-16,"Huawei is probably the only company Nvidia considered potent competitor in chip design. However, no Chinese companies can compete against Nvidia (or Apple and Qualcom) as long as the most advanced IC technology/equipments are prohibited from Chinese companies. Currently it seems Chinese companies are almost catching up, but  the gap will grow rapidly as time goes by. China will regret not acquire as much Nvidia GPUs."
2025-09-16,"China news today on NVDA was definitely a negotiating ploy in relation to US trade talks.  Xi and Trump meet on Friday to discuss TikTok and trade deal.  I’m expecting once the deal is signed, China will fully open up the floodgates for as many NVDA chips they can get their hands on."
2025-09-15,"We know they’re not that good at innovation, but never underestimate their ability to… copy and cost down…"
2025-09-16,Someones holding 🤡
2025-09-15,"They might reverse engineer something someday , but not so sure how fast this really may be.  Huawei is not anywhere close.  And remember inference has just beginning to emerge as a driver for chips.  100x more compute.  Obviously any business would love to have the Chinese market. But there is enough business for Nvidia without them. The standoff will continue as it has with the war simply because anything short of what Putin wants is considered a loss.  Neither the US or China want to appear “losing” in any way  , so here we are.  But as Nvidia shareholders, we have to believe the company will continue to thrive."
2025-09-16,"Those are a lot easier to make + government corruption. Last time they tried to invest heavy to build complex chips the guy just smuggled intel chips to china and laundered all the money. Ever since theyre very careful on investing heavy into it.

I would say theyre still probably 5-7 yrs behind at least."
2025-09-15,"Lol YouTube shorts and Facebook reels copied tiktok, not the other way around"
2025-09-16,Random Redditor knows more than Jensen Huang

Jensen himself says they are really really close to US tech."
2025-09-16,"people don’t know that Nvidia technical leadership is pretty much all older Taiwanese and even some Chinese. And more than half of older Taiwanese see themselves as Chinese and hold anti-American and Japanese sentiments.

It’s not reported but many have hit financial freedom, 20-50m net worth, and opted to join Huawei out of basically sheer patriotism, they don’t need any more money."
2025-09-15,No. They are relentless and execute initiatives at light speed compared to us.
2025-09-15,Short
2025-09-15,"I wonder why we hear all these mixed messages about Chinese companies wanting Nvidia chips. Even ones that are making their own, like Alibaba.  And if they are so close, why are we not seeing or hearing about them competing in the world market.  If their technology was that really really close,one would be seeing use cases in other places than China if that gap is that narrow.  No where to be seen.  Don’t you think the biggest players on the planet, in a race to win the AI race, would want the best chips possible for their use cases?   AMD is holding its own and clearly Broadcom is able to provide bullish guidance for its custom work.  Where is Huawei?   Where’s the beef as was coined in that old Wendy’s commercial."
2025-09-15,"Would you want a chip from an established company or a recent competitor? Bear in mind the competitors chip is still outclassed a little bit by the established company. 

It’s really that simple. The companies have known Nvidia as the standard and they are still more powerful than the homegrown chips. But it doesn’t mean the homegrown ones aren’t close."

You can't really compare Google to Nvidia, however I think a Google - Microsoft comparison is more accurate, and here Microsoft is 30% more valuable. So I think, that over the next year, the market will adjust first and foremost to Google getting out of the legal struggle, and then to their position compared to other similar tech stocks. And so Google will close the gap to Microsoft. Whether or not that Googles valuation will increase or Microsoft will decrease is up to the market. But I think it will be the later, which is why Im deep into Google. They have so many exiciting prospect."

Practically what that means is that they can't focus on doing any *one* thing well.  It happens with a lot of big conglomerates over time.

Plus Google has horrible leadership.


Contrast that with Nvidia: ""we designed GPUs, code for GPUs, and implementation of GPUs"".  Oh and they have a great leadership team.

Obviously this is an exaggerated example and in all cases you factor in risk etc as well but stock price is and always will be based off what a company is expected to do, not what it has done.

So the real question shouldn’t be what they made last quarter but how much do you think each of these companies will make over the next 3-5 years.  Then evaluate whether they are a buy, hold or sell based on that."

The smaller the return the more money there it is in a stock is also easily to disprove.
Take any Mag7 stocks, they have insane amount of money that flow into. 
for instance take nvidia (because it is an nvidia sub) I bought last August for 95$ish and it was worth around how much this August? 180? It's nearly double the return yet it is one of Mag7

Also from an economic perspective inflation and the ability to print money will make every stocks upwards in the long run disproving your theory about there is a ""base"" value of a stock"

2025-09-16,China is not the US. Companies do as they are told. If they don’t their CEO gets reeducated. Jack Ma is a classic example. So yes if the government says don’t buy NVIDIA GPUs then they will comply. That’s why they are developing their own chips.

That said, if you did want to take more risk because “life is too short” I would still not recommend NVDA stock here until it breaks out to a new all-time high. Until that happens, it is susceptible to a deeper pullback, especially if the market finally decides to have a correction. Wednesday’s Fed announcement will be a perfect excuse for it to start."

2025-09-17,No reason to chase the next big thing. That's how you lose 80%. Some investors need to learn this on their own. While others realize this early and do boring index funds. Boring compounding is how you make it to $1M.
2025-09-15,"No, but doing riskier less predictable things means you are probably going to end up with considerably less than if you did  safer proven things. There will be a very very very small percentage of those risk takers who score big. The chances that some particular risk taker will be among those lucky few are very small. But don't let that stop you. The illusion that all of life will be immeasurably better if only you were driving a Lambo can be very strong."
2025-09-15,"But how risky are we talking? I believe in finding the right balance. I’m sure you would agree that someone who is 100% in bonds isn’t taking enough risk and someone who is 100% in a single stock is taking too much. Deciding the right balance is up to the individual and they should understand the risk they are taking. Some people feel like a boglehead 3 fund portfolio is the right balance, that it is the slow and steady wins the race approach, yet it hasn’t won in any 20 year period over other investment strategies. It is however the closest thing to a guaranteed return so it makes sense for a lot of people, because we have no idea what will happen in the future. It also beats most investors who don’t understand behavioral risk. 

My risk tolerance is very high because I don’t want or need to retire and also have several passive income streams that will outlive me. I invest because my cost of living is only 30% of my income and I don’t like having money just sitting around doing nothing. Investing is more entertainment to me than anything since I’m a strategy nerd and watch the stock market like a sport. I’d rather risk the chance of failing at my own strategy than a guarantee of succeeding by following someone else’s."

2025-09-15,"Since everybody has already warned you, I'll just post a simple example:

Stock and Stock2xL are both $100.

Stock goes down 10% to $90, 2xL goes down 20% to $80.

Stock goes back up 10% to $99, 2xL goes up 20% to $96.

The decay is just intrinsic in the percentages and math.  It also works in your favor when stocks have green days.  But in a bear market, you risk that 2xL getting wiped out.

A good example is 2025.  Before Deepseek, NVDL peaked around $83 when Nvidia was $153.  After the huge correction we had, it took Nvidia hitting $175 for NVDL to finally get back to mid $80s.

Edit: The reason I'm so familiar with 2025 movement is because I held NVDL from Janruary until July/Aug.  It was very stupid of me.  Kept buying in $50-60 range for the ETF to go to $83, then all the way to $30, and then finally to $77ish when I sold it.

2025-09-15,"You dense NVDA dick riders. AMD already has a notable grasp on government ran data centers and are more poised to be decision makers in quantum and super computers. 

Data centers are plateauing in a sense of revenue inflow, AMD will take hold of the opening and cause a complete transition into their hardware being utilized. Intel has CPUs that run parallel now, just like GPUs with NVDAs SLI technology being utilized. AMD has the best CPUs, the best Multiprocessing GPUs and the least optimized software known to man. Let them scale into software and development with HiP and NVDA will stay where it’s at if not find a lower PPS to sit at.

Forward split will bring shares down 1/2 the price they currently are for NVDA so retail can get in at fathomable prices (already a discussed thing) MMs will short the company at that point to profit on new liquidity. Company will be dead in a decade if they don’t focus on their roots."
2025-09-22,"2028 it’s projected to hit 171b FCF, today’s value is trading 25x 2028 FCF."
2025-09-16,You’re making a lot of assumptions and how does decreased revenue in data centers create an opening for AMD? You’re essentially saying a decrease in demand is good for AMD which makes absolutely no sense. A rising tide lifts all boats and a falling tide sinks all ships

2025-09-14,"The issue about this is that this person chose strike prices very far out of the money with very little time to expiration which means these contracts have a high probable chance of expiring worthless. Now anything can happen in the stock market, but you also want to make sure your plays are more realistic so you’re not just throwing money down the drain"

2025-09-13,"I’m really liking these small option swing trades, as long as I don’t get to greedy they have been nice. I just believe Nvidia hits around 200 by Christmas and that’s a nice $500 play"
2025-09-14,"I would recommend paper trading options on ThinkOrSwim so then you can practice being profitable with options and see what works and what doesn’t. Some brokerages offers that platform for free as well. But tbh I think most people should stick with selling covered calls, it’s really easy to grasp the concept of how they work. And the more shares you own, the more contracts you can sell on a regular basis"
2025-09-14,"You're just gambling and gamblers lose in the end.  You should be adding to index funds and never selling till you're 65, but I can tell you're young and stupid"
2025-09-14,I have been reading about covered calls but my issue is I dont want to lose my stocks and idk if I am not connecting the dots yet or what but I dont understand why id do covered calls if I dont really want to sell my stocks. Would I make enough to buy my stock back at the price its at and still take a profit? And good simple reading you'd recommend on covered calls?
2025-09-14,"It depends on the stock, all premiums they offer are different but if you can find a stock where you can choose a strike price that’s somewhat out of the average range the stock normally moves in then you can probably get away with selling covered calls and not worry about your shares getting sold. You can also do a strangle by buying an equal amount of calls to the covered calls you’ve sold, for example last week I sold two covered calls on Nebius and got $302 (this was a day before the stock rocketed) and then I bought 2 calls (I’ve spent 1K total because the date was a lot further out). Fast forward to the next day when the stock went up $30, my covered calls are in the money and I’m going to let them expire in the money at the $68 price. The 2 calls I bought were now worth 6K, so they pretty much gain you the same amount of money even though your shares are going to get called away

Total money I’ve made from the strangle option method last week was $5.3K — this is pretty much what I do, I just buy contracts that covers for other possible scenarios while taking into consideration the average movement the stock does on a daily basis. I think I’ve gotten pretty decent at hedging my positions because I’ve been hedging against my 200 shares of NVIDIA since June last year and that time has also been a roller coaster

After the rate cut decision is released, I’m going to buy another 200 shares of Nebius and do the strangle method again. I highly recommend testing different strategies paper trading to see what works best on certain stocks"

2025-09-13,"I’ve heavily considered it, but I’m young moving old school. Leverage is a headache to me. Bc then I’ll have to decide at what point I want to convert leverage to common shares or double down… etc

At this point I’m common but should we get another drop I’ll probably utilize leverage. Maybe leaps"
2025-09-14,"I’ve been in nvdx for 18 months and I believe up to now NVDA would have outperformed. But now that nvda is raging it’s catching up very fast

2025-09-13,Nas in this bih! Legendary are you running any options or just buying stocks.
2025-09-13,So you’re predicting the stock will rise by 1% next week?
2025-09-13,"One way or another, we are all going up as Nvidia shareholders.  Many of us have had good fortune getting in early and watching this once in a lifetime stock emerge and grow. We’ve watched a great leader build collaborations and partnerships and even purchases to strengthen the business model and create moat after moat.  Clearly there is room for everyone in spite of this, Broadcom and AMD are proof. That said, we still lead the way and will for the foreseeable future.   To that , I say, bbbbooyahh boys!!  Enjoy watching the morons continue their bullshit banter, when will it end, they only have 4 big customers. Absurd. These guys are clowns."
2025-09-13,"If NVDA hits $190 you can spend that $22 million to merge your two yachts into one big yacht, wouldn’t that be more useful?

2025-09-12,"Has to be!!!

Haha love the energy — NVDA’s been a freight train and every dip just keeps getting bought up. As long as earnings momentum and AI hype stay hot, shorts are gonna keep getting smoked. Ride the wave but keep stops tight, this name can whip fast."
2025-09-11,"I’ll tell you this, diversifying your portfolio will greatly reduce your risk but also your chances of becoming wealthy. My dad has been working at Oracle for 33 years, I’ve been telling him for years to sell his stock and put it into dividends as he’s getting ready to retire. 100% of his portfolio is Oracle. Yesterday our family became multi millionaires. Over half of employees at NVDA are millionaires (I think it’s like 70%). Yea both examples are lucky, but… If you got the balls and you believe in a company you can get wealthy off that belief and conviction. 

With that said I am pretty diversified as I don’t have the balls. My biggest holding being NVDA. But my third biggest holding is OKLO!"
2025-09-11,Eh. I do agree you must take risk but don’t look at index’s as some sort of get rich scheme. Index’s are low risk high reward. Over a 20 year period they’re basically supercharged high yield savings account
2025-09-11,Scared money don’t make money…yes sir!!
2025-09-12,Two things will never make you rich: 1. Salaried job 2. Investing in ETFs
2025-09-12,Earn more and regularly invest in good individual stocks. Its the only middle ground
2025-09-12,"Hmmm… I get it. But “if” you started in your 20’s,30’s stayed the course on some investments and took “some” risk on others. I’m 60 now,crazy looking back damn life is gooood. Thank god my d*** works fine🤣. 
Good luck investing all!!!
Get in the game at least!"
2025-09-12,I got lucky with NVDA. I had never heard of them when I started buying small amounts in 2020. I just kept adding and adding every paycheck. Then a few years later sold all NVDA and put all that money in NVDL and it exploded the last 2 years. I went from 190k net worth to 2.3 million in just a few years. Now I'm selling half my NVDA and diversifying. Husband and I are 56 and 62. Need safer investments.
2025-09-11,I'm literally making crazy money selling spx spreads
2025-09-12,That’s why I invest in options and cocaine.
2025-09-12,"What is wealthy to you?  
I have a net worth of 6 million and indexing has worked just fine.  I suggest you do some basic math with a financial calculator and you will see for yourself.  
As background I am a physician and didn’t even have a real paycheck of over $100,000/year until I was 30 years old because of education and residency.  I am now 53 and I am close to retiring on my simple indexed investments."
2025-09-12,Gona keep holding TLRY
2025-09-13,"Exactly. Its just a safe way to invest, and ensure you have extra money when it comes to retirement. But, I dont want just that. I want MONEY. That why i invest. I have all my money in 3 stocks, and some in S&P 500."
2025-09-12,Depends on what wealthy means.  But I agree with you in general. At first I just did money market. Then started investing index funds.  Then blue stock dividend stocks.  And then only when I finally decided to transition to tech stocks did I really start getting any real feel good appreciation in my net worth.
2025-09-12,"Only buy the good stocks and buy low, sell high is what I say"
2025-09-12,"The rest of reddit doesn't understand this. If you just stick to VOO, you'll end up with $1-2.5 million on an average salary when you're old. But if you take some risks, you could easily end up with $5-10 million. Sure you might lose to VOO but what's really the difference between $1-2.5 million and $500K-1 million. At the end of the day you're not going to be living it up, you're still going to have to be conscious with your spending at $1-2.5 million, thus it's worth it to take risks. If you fail and don't make as much as you should have then so what, your lifestyle isn't going to change much either way. But the upside is too high not to."
2025-09-12,"Is 2 million for a 42 yo considered rich now, or nah?"
2025-09-13,Speak for yourself.  I don’t make anywhere near 1% money and still managed to get to $2.5M invested assets at age 50.  Will be a lot more at age 65.  It’s all about investing early and aggressively (in terms of amount saved - not aggressive in terms of risk).  Time will do the rest.
2025-09-14,"I think you're right.What I do is I do a 60/40 blend.60% in an S&P,500 fund, 40% is in 10 stocks give or take.
It's working well for me.I've been beating the market now for at least 8 out of the last ten years. It requires work however.  I must spend about five hours a week watching over it. A lot of people don't have the lifestyle to be able to do that.  Good luck!"

2025-09-16,"I don't think THAT is big balls(he may well have them)... but my Grandpa was the co-founder of a company publicly traded, not OTC, but a small cap. He only held that company for 35 years. My parents only held that company. 

Unlike Oracle, this was a company that was doing well, but the industry was/is dying.

My Grandparents went from(according to my Grandma) worth mid 8 figures to cutting that in half the year she passed.

I took what I got invested in Real Estate...until I sold because it was just too much work, stress... just not as good as the market, but my patents finally let me help them a few years later.

I put quite a bit in NVDA for them in 2023. NVDA, AVGO, META, I didn't even know what NVDA was when I first invested 4 years before that, but...back to the point. Everyone of my Uncles, my Dad, they all worked at the same place and their profit sharing/stock options made all of them 7 figures. There was a year they got a MONSTER contract for them. A two year difference from when my Uncle started to my Dad. 1974 to 1976. Ended up being a 6-7M difference in profit sharing(for my Uncle). But when a company is successful, people tend to just keep their money in that one investment in my experience.

Oracle is... exponentially larger and to be clear, my Grandpa owned very little of this company, but...enough."
2025-09-12,"I do this, sort of. I have a big chunk in Mag7 (minus Tesla, I've subbed in AVGO instead). Then most of the remainder of my portfolio is tech, with a couple of exceptions. Heavy space play in the mix. Some quantum. I've worked in tech for a long time and feel like it's easier for tech industry people to figure out which ones to pick than it is for the average investor. But I would do QQQ over the S&P 500 in any case."
2025-09-12,"There was a study that only like 4% of the stocks are responsible for the gains of the index over the past 100 years. Of course, the 4% are always changing but if you are good in stock picking then you can easily beat the index because the other 96% are holding the 4% down. Mag7 is a great example and the reason why SP500 has performed much better than Russell 2000 which is crazy because usually small caps have higher risk and reward but Mag7 grew much more than many small caps lol.

Nasdaq 100 is a more concentrated index where Mag7 was even more concentrated and it basically shows that Mag7 was all you had to own in the past 10 years. I wouldn't be even surprised if it's all you need in the next decade as well. These companies are so good at innovating that they still manage to grow nicely even with their large size."
2025-09-12,"Index = market average returns. 
Market average returns > than most individual investor returns.

2025-09-12,"The vast majority of the non ETF crowd perform worse than the index. Being an NVDA investor myself, I know that I’m an exception and the vast majority of investors aren’t as fortunate. 

It’s not like investing in individual stocks is a get rich quick life hack as for the amount of “NVDA millionaires”, there are even more people who are losing. 

Thus endorsing and hailing investing in individual companies as this incredible opportunity for wealth is wrong and dangerous for new investors who are unaware of the nuances and risks of investment"

2025-09-12,Do you think nvda can 4X or 10x?  That led be $15T or 35T. 4X would be half of US GDP (29T). Do you think it can double get to $7T?  If not then might be hard to make it 2 mil if you only have 150k now

2025-09-11,"I'm sure there is. I don't think we are going to see explosive growth until some new catalyst shows up like general purpose robotics so temper your expectations. Growth will look similar to other large tech companies. The stock will drop from time to time due to manipulators scaring people (see deep seek and other chip makers).  Just relax and don't panic sell. Thats where you will lose if you do that.

Make sure you understand their business and what their products actually are. If you do that then bullshit like deep seek and phony chips that are suppose to be better won't bother you. Nvidia is more than just chips, thats why anyone competing with them is going to run into a massive undertaking (see CUDA).

Just keep a close eye on the entire tech industry if you are going all in. Nvidia has a few huge customers, mainly the other large tech companies. So if they start having trouble, they won't be able to buy nvidia's products. This is why the chinese market is so important as well.

I still wouldn't put every last dime in any one thing even if its nvidia, mainly because there are other stocks that will see even larger growth."

2025-09-12,Good luck
2025-09-12,"I don’t see this as a problem if you don’t have a lot of money invested and this is a short term strategy. You can always put most of your money into a broader portfolio later, once you have enough money invested  that you want to diversify. But if this was a 500k+ portfolio I definitely wouldn’t go all in on one investment, even if it’s NVDA."

2025-09-12,All-in NVDA solid play depending on PPS. My portfolio 8Xed using the same strategy over 2.5 years but I’ve been in and out of NVDA for 8 years from $66 two splits ago.
2025-09-12,"If you are young, this is OK.  NVDA is a good long term bet.  But NVDA is priced to perfection and likely needs a few solid quarters of gains to begin to move up again much beyond its recent highs.  You also have to be prepared to ride out one or more 10% or 15% drops in price — similar to what we experienced last April."
2025-09-12,"I have about 15% of my investments in nvda and it feels very high. But I continued to buy dips after getting in March driving down my average price per share, never meant for it to be this high. I’ll soon have it down to 10% as I continue to invest elsewhere. 

It’s a lot of risk all in on one stock, people usually do this at earlier point. I’m not sure upside at this point makes
Sense to take that much risk."
2025-09-12,"Not financial advice.  There is always a balance between returns vs what you are willing to risk (capital preservation). 

A long time ago it was observed that if you own a company any wild law suit or accident or competition could arise that would wreck your position and cause massive loss of capital.

People realized as you add companies to your portfolio you could reduce this risk.  We call this risk unsystematic risk, or idiosyncratic risk.  We can reduce this by diversifying.  As you diversify more we recognized that there was still a risk called systemic risk which is market wide risk.  When markets crash all assets are correlated.

If you are too diversified you choke out any gains you could make.  This is because a good portfolio attempts to achieve un correlated returns.  But if all your holdings cancel each other out it greatly reduces your gains.

So we came up with risk-related returns.  The trade off of risk and returns."

Can only imagine where I’d be if all that tuition money went into the market and Nvidia mainly. Been very hard to hold on to with unprecedented volatility. Glad I stayed with my gut, noticing they were putting billions and billions into R&D for a decade. Jensen knew where computing was going long before anyone else . He is doing his same magic with Quantum Computing lab in the Educational Hub Boston and MIT & Harvard’s best will be developing on Nvidia’s operating systems as with CUDA."

2025-09-15,"The diversification rule does not apply to Nvidia. It's stock has minted more millionaires than any other stock in stock market history! And to think it is only in its infancy right now. That's right this is just the very beginning phase of AI. There hasn't been a technological revolution this big since the internet became available in households across America.

NVIDIA  is not a stock that you trade, its a stock that you own and hold, otherwise known as an investment. Those smart enough to load their vaults with NVIDIA now will reap tremendous Rewards two to three years from now. Those who don't get on board and stay on board will be labeled as complete NVIDIOTS !

2025-09-11,"Do you have a plan for what happens if selling resumes and it goes back to 165 or lower? Will you just keep adding on the dips and accept huge paper losses with confidence that the stock will recover?

I'm not making a prediction, but with the market stretched and NVDA underperforming, if the market does decide to have a typical September-October correction, NVDA is vulnerable."
2025-09-11,You like buying high and selling low… because that’s likely what you’re going to end up doing
2025-09-12,"I just sold NVDA at a slight loss after making good money with it this year in and out. look how cheap the call options are, and the huge outflows from the stock. I urge you to reconsider your position very seriously, or at least hedge. Perhaps you could get out of your position and instead buy some cheap calls."
2025-09-15,I did the same sold amazon tesla rivn to buy lot of nvidia at 750 in March
2025-09-12,"Start selling call options at different strikes and expirations.  You might get called out in a few but that’s not a bad thing with a stock that’s not likely to have an explosive up tick.  When you get called out, rather than buy in, sell puts.  You will find that this is a safer way to earn a reasonable return on your money with less risk than outright owning the stock.  Good luck!"
2025-09-12,"I’m 85% NVDA. 12k shares. Started investing in 2019 and been through 2 splits. I know I’m supposed to diversify but how do I sell when I know the run isn’t done. If I listened to all the financial advisors, I’d be in a very different financial state."

Then I switched to 4 positions and I consider cash as a position with I hold about 40% cash and 3 others . I find I can pick and follow 3-4 positions much better
And buy big in the positions and sell and buy back the same 3-4 75% and I’m doing very well so far. Can’t see the future though but when opportunity knocks I always have the cash to hit and run or build on dips. Im holdings RKLB, Uber, and Hood and APLD with is riding NVDA

It could turn out great, and it could at best not track with the S&P well.   But how much upside is there in the short term?  What is his strategy?   Going all in on NVDA because gAiNz! imo is just ignorant financial management."
2025-09-12,"I would say I hope you put in a lot but even if not, you are probably sitting on a pile of cash. Good job."
2025-09-12,I'm telling this to everyone here because I'd feel badly if I didn't. Look at the options pricing and the outflows. Premiums for calls are way down. Outflows are way up. I got the fuck out today.
2025-09-12,"30% here after being in almost 50%, bought TSM with the gains and happy for the 50% jump from $164 there!"
2025-09-13,"Yep, years ago it would cost you 40 bucks commission for 1 trade.
That’s a good reason why grey beards hold so long"
2025-09-12,Banking industry not looking good. NVDA call option premiums way down. NVDA outflows way up. NVDA put/call interest nearing 1 but still technically bullish (whopping .96). RR looks interesting.
2025-09-12,I'm making a prediction by reading the tea leaves of options pricing. This thing is going down along with the rest of the market by winter time.
2025-09-13,That why have just a few3-4 positions is easy to sell. You hold 20 and by the time your way down on your sell list you lose big time.
2025-09-13,"Too much tech fighting for not enough room. Tech bubble is setting up and I was there in March 2000 and just made it out as I had doubleclick and it went up 400% on buyouts.

Tech is carrying this market now but as billionaires turn trillionaires they eat millionaires for breakfast just to keep competition
Out then pop goes the bubble, well I don’t have to ever worry about that
lol"
2025-09-13,All 50 shares right ? Wait until you learn about margin. Then you can own 100 shares total at full margin.
2025-09-12,What do the call options and outflows show? I don’t understand them. Why do you think a 4 trillion dollar company with crazy revenue forecasts could go under? Interested in your thinking and thanks for any response in advance.
2025-09-12,"The red flag here is ""new to investing"".  I'm not saying your strategy is bad, but sending someone to go play options when they aren't even remotely experienced probably won't end well.   OP should go paper trade for awhile before making big decisions, and get comfortable with safer long term diversified investments while he builds experience."
2025-09-12,Well you can't make much selling call options on it right now -- all the premiums are down through December. And there are huge outflows from the stock. I wouldn't want to be on the hook to buy at any price right now. Today I sold.
2025-09-12,"Sell in chunks and reinvest over time. The time period and chunk size depend on your tolerance for risk.

You got lucky and made big profits. You're already a winner. Don't let greed spoil that"

2025-09-12,"If this is unrealized gains, you're in exactly the same financial state. Or some could argue a worst financial state as you're too invested with a single company."
2025-09-12,"Keep in mind that diversification doesn’t always mean broad index funds. 

I invested in a tech-focused ETF that included a considerable percentage of NVDA and made a good chunk of money

Also, agreed on the questionable upside of NVDA nowadays"
2025-09-12,"Because I bought into it after trading it buy the dips and sold the rips after the split I have 16 shares up 335%,but I don't see any momentum until there is some catalyst"
2025-09-12,Options pricing and common stock outflows say the smart money thinks it's about to drop...right along with the broader market.
2025-09-12,"Yea I plan to reduce my exposure a little, it’s too much at this point. I have massive gains I really don’t want to recognize"
2025-09-12,"I agree that NVDA might not be out of the woods despite this bounce.

When NASDAQ makes all-time highs without its elite leader, something doesn't quite add up.

Doesn't mean the market is falling apart tomorrow, though, just that there is a divergence that needs to get resolved one way or the other: NVDA joins the party at new highs, or there is risk it will lead us lower."
2025-09-13,3 college tuitions and a short run to a couple million! $2000 investment even your Columbo brain could see I may have added some more! Saw this in the crypto frenzy! Idiots knowing nothing but hate and JEALOUSY AH
2025-09-12,"Hey good questions. I'm not saying they can go under. I'm saying that the 'smart money' is getting out of AND betting against the market writ large,  save for the kinds of stocks that do well in a large geopolitical event like US invading Venezuela, a civil war starting after some suspicious events in the homeland, invading Iran, or not stopping Russia taking over Odessa. 


Anyone can check options prices and people track optionsprices to see what people betting on the future of a stock are willing to pay. I'm going to keep this simple in case you are going to go look for yourself. 


What you look for is which strikes (price targets for a stock) have the most action, and how much premium is paid for those bets, and where the highly hedged strikes are located. So for NVDA, you want to see if there's a lot of put buying at a price further down than where it traded today or call buying at a price way above. And you want to see what the price changes are for those calls/puts. The price of options change for a few reasons, but the least complicated to think about is the fact that if someone expected NVDA to be at $185 or above by some Friday in November, they paid much more for that possibility two days ago than they did yesterday. Even though the stock is doing fine and isn't even making large moves in one direction or another, the expectation of it going up by the people who normally make those large bets is dropping pretty dramatically; in fact they are selling calls and buying puts, which is betting on the stick moving downward. This is true even for SPY, which is the top 500 stocks, heavily weighted by the Mag 7 (which includes NVDA). 


When I mentioned outflow, this is another statistic you can look up. A stock can stay around the same price with a lot of volume going one way or the other. It can go up or down on low volume. It can go down on a lot of buying volume. What you want to know is what it means. NVDA has been ok as far as price, but the volume is much more in selling than you would think for something that anyone here would have argued is too low just a couple of weeks ago. "
2025-09-12,Yea yea.. imma just let it get to $250 first
2025-09-12,Cost basis as low as $5/share but sure

2025-09-12,"You mentioned “smart money.” 6 of the 7 mag 7’s have 3% of their float shorted. NVDA has .84% shorted as of August 31. 

Also, traders are constantly taking profits and hoping for dips. It doesn’t matter to them if it’s NVDA or any other company. They study charts and trade on movements, hoping to be correct 75% of the time. It’s a different game. We study fundamentals like earnings growth and forward guidance. NVDA is a once in a lifetime gem that’s making a lot of folks wealthy. You must do your own DD, take ideas from others, but act on your own DD, but NVDA is a perfect long hold!"
2025-09-12,Thanks (and thank goodness there is no risk of the geopolitical events you mention happening 😊) I guess I wonder what makes these options the “smart money?” Wouldn’t the smart money be institutional v retail investors? Or are options generally traded by institutional investors and hedge funds?
2025-09-12,That kind of thinking will make below $100 again this year a certainly.
2025-09-12,Pigs get slaughtered
2025-09-12, ❤️❤️same price I’m selling a bit too 😂😂😂
2025-09-12,What I'm suggesting is a massive drop would hit very hard.  I'd get no sleep at hight being 85% NVDA.  At 5% I'd sell at least half of it.
2025-09-12,"Shorting is much, much more expensive than options. I agree it's good long term but I have powder for whatever is coming because I'd rather buy it back cheaply. "
2025-09-12,The smart money is the huge volume. Your and my $50k is nothing. 
2025-09-12,"Wouldn’t be the first time and I didn’t sell then either, but if it does… you’re welcome for the sale"
2025-09-12,Actually pigs get fat. It’s the hogs that get slaughtered!
2025-09-12,If anything the US will do  almost anything to prevent their golden goose from going under. Do believe the market is catching up to inflation and devaluation of the dollar as to why they keep going higher despite worse news about the economy coming out.
2025-09-12,As long as it doesn’t matter to you what company it is. It’s not likely NVDA will dip much any time soon. Oracle’s recent earnings indicated just how much they would be buying from NVDA for their data centers. NVDA is the best company on the planet with a PEG ratio of 1.22!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It’s a good buy now. Be long NVDA and trade other companies that you know swing up and down a lot.
2025-09-12,"I mean, it was 94 this year already. I bought it for that price."
2025-09-12,"I wish. There were huge amounts of sell-to-close on ORCLE calls (profit-taking) from the 230-250 strikes. It and NVDA are now *the two tech stocks with the highest bearish delta*; as the price decreases, the options prices increase. I am not going to argue with the numbers just because I love the company. The stock market loves nobody back. "
2025-09-12,What caused it to drop to $94 just a few months ago? There doesn't need to be a fundamental change for a stock with a P/E of 50 to drop a ton.
2025-09-11,I’m pretty jealous too. I was there at the beginning of the hype and sold at a loss when it dumped to around $2.50. Everyone was saying it was a rug pull and to get out while you still can.
2025-09-11,"I Bought open at 5k at $1.27 and sold at $2.5 thinking I was doing awesome 


So FML"
2025-09-11,Being holding since first rug pull
2025-09-11,I have several options a on OPEN and it’s popping: I got in at a low price and now I’m at $366% gain… whoooosh to the moon!
2025-09-11,It's great to hold both.

2025-09-12,Holding some @0.72. I'm not selling

2025-09-12,Still holding
2025-09-12,I bought $500 last Friday just planning to forget about it and see if it meme’d or squeezed. I laughed when I opened today to see it up 80% at one point.
2025-09-12,"Just sold today.  I guess the reassuring thing is that few people will put significant amounts into OPEN just due to it's size and risk.  I only had 2000 shares so I made like a couple grand.  It's a much different story when you own 2000 shares of, say, Nvidia.  I've made much more on the large positions of blue chips than my fun gamble play positions of like $10-30k."
2025-09-12,I bought at $4 and sold at a loss and then it moon right after. I was the sacrifice 😂
2025-09-12,"Sell NVDA, Buy OPEN"
2025-09-12,I’m thinking of gambling a few grand and buying puts
2025-09-12,"Got in at 65 cents. Was up 1400% earlier today. 


Also bought qbts at 88 cents,  mvst at 18 cents, hims at 8.5, lunr at 2.5, rklb at 5, ionq at 7.

2025-09-15,I’m not. Been holding bagsss at 21 per shares for years recently bought some at 4 to dilute it. I don’t see how advance it can be on flipping houses

2025-09-11,"Sell enough to cover your initial buy, and ride the rest."
2025-09-11,Lost everything in the first rug pull by panic selling
2025-09-11,Congrats to us bag holders lol
2025-09-12,I’d like to run on a stock rising & ready to take off even 30%.
2025-09-12,"Literally everyone was saying that. Anyone who liked the stock was banished to like 2 different subs, and it was only after the clowns posting loss porn after buying puts got exposed on here did they turn around on OPEN. "
2025-09-12,"Ngl that rug pull was unprecedented, shook out a lot of hands, I got shook too. Since then I’ve been dabbling and taking positions on and off, making a thousand or two here and there. Finally yesterday of all days, when I saw the pullback, I put about 3% of my portfolio saying WTH, let me do it. 

I think I might ride it longer this time. Whether you go from $3 to $30 or $6 to $30 or $10 to $30, if you are confident it will get there, just put money in it and forget about it."
2025-09-11,"didn’t know much about them tbh and the price history was sketch, was more focused on other stocks at the time,  and didn’t really give it the time of day, same would be said for pltr at 15$ and sofi at 5$ but that’s how stocks go."
2025-09-12,"I wanted to get in PLTR when it was $8 but my financial advisor said No. I’ve not listened to him since. I bought NVDA, XOM, MSFT, APPL etc. have had 1 loser out of 21 picks: was Canopy when Biden said during election he planned to do something about med weed. I didn’t lose much. Rest have done very well. Trust my gut."
2025-09-12,"yeah trust my gut is a huge one i’m young and still learning so i’m taking everything i see now and using it as a tool for my future, i’ve lost so many potentials from pulling out to reinvest else where, like on dennison mines, aswell as tlry. now that im around money consistently ill be able to dive into these sectors and not feel i have to pull out to reinvest elsewhere. see you in turks!"

Once U make your investments,  back pull that $ out & put it solid ETFs etc:I have 1/3 in Fidelity, 1/3 in Vanguard & 1/3 in stocks. I want my grandkids to have college fund when I’m gone cuz who knows what it’ll cost in 8-13yrs. I hear U. If I knew more I’d hop in calls but not sure I feel I should.

2025-09-11,"So let me be clear, Oracle mist on all earnings however they said that they’ve got the four contracts to supply whatever until the year 2030 however, two of the companies won’t be able to afford to pay for the products and how are they going to get the energy source to even fulfill these contracts?  It’s kind of like a smoking dagger. Don’t look here that we’ve missed our earnings. Look here that we’ve got these contracts that we quite possibly won’t be able to fulfill, but let’s have our stock run up $89.  Anybody who owns Oracle do a deep dive and do your research… infact

2025-09-11,lol Why wouldn’t you hold? Were you considering selling at a loss?
2025-09-11,Holding is great but ideally it would be better to sell when it peaks and then re buy even more shares before it makes its guaranteed recovery.
2025-09-14,"I wouldn't say it's undervalued...

I would guess it's PE is going to keep slowly coming down until it's in the 30s.

But I think we're ~3-4 years and maybe an ~9T/10T market cap by then...

Or, maybe the even more bullish people are right.

I know I'm not buying more... since I'm already so heavily invested in it, AVGO, TSM...and even a few thousand shares of AMD.

I've re-set my price target half a dozen times. ""If it hits 400, I'm selling,"" and instead...I bought more.

I was going to add that it’s impossible to predict the future and very difficult to time the market, but it’s still helpful to watch for signs of reversals and set stop losses to avoid any major losses. Then all you have to do is decide when it’s a good time to get back in."
2025-09-12,"I totally agree with that, unless you end up in a bit of a flat period where it's probably not going to do much until next earnings...then I try and find that sweet back and forth range until closer to earnings to buy and sell in a handful of times to make some extra cash while waiting"
2025-09-12,Sorry for your loss...Or happy for your gains??...I dunno you pick the one that best works. I'm hoping the reason for your divorce isn't what inspired your Reddit username 😂

2025-09-12,"Yeah which is why I only do it when AMD is just in a slog state back and forth while waiting for earnings, or for someone to release some insane news 😆 If I read the daily amd tech analysis by JWCommander217, his read of the graphs along with other factors going on does really help me find some quick wins when we're in wait mode. As things pickup again I'll find a spot, go all-in and let it sit for many months again."
2025-09-13,My first investing experience was with weed stocks back in 2016. Trust me by the time 2020 came around the only words in my mind were “I should’ve sold.” I was up over 300k and let it ride back all the way to nothing 😂. I’ve learned since then.

2025-09-13,"I did have a small amount of CGC. I did sell in profit. I did NOT gamble big, or get on the TILRAY TRAIN. The main problem was once it became legal, the market was oversaturated. In NY, there are too many individual shops. No need for a huge conglomerate."
2025-09-10,"Big win for NVDA — partnering with a quantum player like PsiQuantum just adds another growth lane outside GPUs/AI. At a $7B tag, it’s still early innings, but the tie-up could give Nvidia first dibs when quantum hits scale. Long-term bullish signal for their ecosystem."
2025-09-10,This isn’t a prediction. It’s spam
2025-09-10,"People actually just look at shapes in a line to predict how a stock is going to perform? No analysis of market factors? Nothing. Just drawing shapes... 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

Please be a joke."
2025-09-10,"I'm a fan of chart analysis. But it seems to make this work you need a breakdown of recent support (proven very strong around 164). How about we get there first before we consider ridiculous downside predictions.

It's a bull market and there is very little chance NVDA will ever see a 72% drawdown, but keep dreaming."
2025-09-11,"So the stock is going to drop 3/4 of its current price only to triple from that price (which is only 84% of its current price) not going to happen. The market is volatile, but it doesn’t turn on and off like a light switch"
2025-09-10,"What i like most about nvda is long term we dont have to worry, barring extraordinary events. It dips 72%, meh it will rise again as a the poors i can buy a little more. So not only do i nkt buy this ""chart"", it doesnt matter"
2025-09-10,"For it to go down 72% there has to be a catalyst, their earnings were very good. Even if you see some signs of slowing, 72%???

The rest of the economy would have to be in a massive tailspin"
2025-09-10,"In the future,  the price might be different than today. 

I think my prediction is better,  since it says nothing."

2025-09-10,There’s no way -72% happens unless the whole market goes bearish
2025-09-11,"This doesn't take into account anything that caused those drops...

NVDA tanked in 2022 partly because everything else was tanking due to QT and also partly due to a real revenue collapse in both gaming and cryptocurrency mining. In particular, ethereum shifting from proof of work to proof of stake dramatically reduced need for NVDA GPUs.

It only began surging back again in 2023 and onwards because of AI.

It tanked again in april this year (around 40%) due to trump tariff threats, that, I guess, the market is disregarding or doesn't think will really affect NVDA.

If AI ends up being a flop and the stock tanks 70% again, what is going to be the catalyst that pushes it back up 300%? AI really was always going to be the next major tech push, I'm not sure what else there is that will require their GPUs at the same level. And certainly not sure what would require you to have the very best that is NVDA compared to competitors, which means their profit margin would likely erode as well.

So, my take is that you'd better hope AI doesn't end up being a flop, because if it does, NVDA is cooked.

So far, AI is absolutely not a flop. It is very good and useful for work in many industries, although it is not perfect. But in theory it should only get better. Main question we're seeing with it today is how will it actually create revenue for companies like openAI. Current prediction is free usage was just to drive users, and they will implement a subscription fee regardless what tier you're at, and it will no longer be free.

TLDR: NVDA tanked from revenue compression from massive decline in gaming/crypto mining + quantitative tightening by the Fed. It rallied from those lows due to AI. If AI flops it could drop 70%, but what catalyst will it have to go back up 300%? So there will not be any massive drops like that again tbh."
2025-09-11,Hm so the price will drop 72% soon?
2025-09-11,"You guys need to chill out, buy the dips, and hold."
2025-09-11,Investment skill issue 😂
2025-09-11,"People need to stop trying to read tea leaves and making other nonsensical predictions. It’s an era defining company just buy more when it goes down unless something significant changes. 

People who think long term make money, people with poor impulse control trying to time everything usually don’t."
2025-09-11,"Look impressive, but it is pure bullsh^t guessing"
2025-09-11,"There is so much craziness in the macroeconomy that I could see a couple of events pushing NVDA down 30%, which would be about 120.  But long before we get there the algorithmic buying will begin.  I think that's why a bearish period of a couple months where we land at 150-160 is very possible still this year."
2025-09-11,Who else  is left to buy GPUs?
2025-09-11,"Put an AVWAP on the 2022 low and the ATH, watch those two squeeze as price drops, when price regains those avwap, and breaks above, look for retest of those AVWAP then enter."

2025-09-13,How do you guys ignore fundamentals to this point? Has the news been good for them. Not great not terrible. They have a lot of headwinds. If you want long term look at fundamentals. Not technical.

We are in the last last quarts of 25 and stock are expected to to rise to rise before fallen in 1st quarter of 26.

2025-09-10,"This would be awesome. Huge opportunity to load up

2025-09-10,Hahaa I'd even get my grandma to buy some!
2025-09-11,"I wouldnt.

If NVDA falls 72% it means the AI vision is dead and they will never have as much revenue or high profit margins ever again."
2025-09-10,"😂😂😂💀💀 He said, who cares about y axis while you can just draw a straight line and let you guess the rest? Trump and friends are buying the dips."

2025-09-10,"Funnily enough, my grandma already owns more than I do because her financial advisor bought a good chunk some years ago, pre-split."
2025-09-11,"Obviously it depends on the reason for the drop. If it's a broad market sell-off, another ""oh no, deepseek!"" moment, or even the AI bubble collapsing, I'm buying. The AI bubble is like the internet bubble-- the technology is real & disruptive, but the bubble is all the companies that make fantastical claims about AGI/replacing your whole workforce/etc. When the bubble pops, companies will still be using AI to increase productivity. 

If it dropped 72% because a competitor is consistently eating NVIDIA's lunch, then yeah, I'm selling."
2025-09-13,I don’t believe we’re going to see that kind of drop in NVDA for a while (years). Next stop 200+. Spend on AI infrastructure likely to keep increasing for at least next 3-4 years. You would have done well to buy on latest pull back if you don’t already own.
2025-09-10,"Idk maybe but I hold NVDA and have for a long time and tbh, nothing is stopping NVDA at the moment! GPU growth will accelerate and they have the best products and leadership. Either way, I’m in for the long haul"
2025-09-10,😂😂😂😂 I have a crystal ball like Pelosi. I saw this on X though. Not my prediction.
2025-09-10,"I bookmark what I want bro. And for this particular guy, I want to say hello to him when what he's predicting doesn't happen. Anything else??"
2025-09-11,"Because if what he predicts comes true, we are seeing a -70% soon, which might be bad news for people selling soon or on margins."
2025-09-10,Hahaa good for her!
2025-09-11,I’m not letting mine go. Period. Bought @$60. Sticking till HFO. It’s made me enough $ I’m good to go. If it goes down more than 20% I may buy more. I like JH.

2025-09-10,"This Rubin CPX drop is a straight game-changer — NVDA basically flexing its dominance in AI infra. A million-token context + 8 exaflops in one rack? That’s future-proofing like crazy. If they execute on rollout by ’26, this could juice their rev streams way beyond gaming/GPUs and keep the stock ripping long-term."
2025-09-10,"Big move—NVIDIA backing QuEra just shows they’re hedging the next frontier beyond GPUs. Quantum + accelerated compute is a long game, but NVDA planting seeds early usually pays off. Not something for quick flips, but definitely worth watching as the ecosystem builds."

I own about 500 nvda stocks for years and ok to take a profit if it goes up 20% in 3 weeks. One point my call executed $165 that i sold when it was $145. I think cc is ok as far as you use it for safe defn not to make big money. Also selling put is the same way..

2025-09-10,"Buffett’s playbook has always been patience + quality, and that edge still holds up even in this AI-driven market. NVDA is the shiny object right now, but the real Buffett-style move is looking for names with durable moats that can ride multiple cycles.

2025-09-09,"I think getting the direction of a stock alone is hard. Not to mention adding a premium, price, AND time aspect.

So I’d say that options markets are gambling. You can win if you position yourself on the other side of gambling degenerates. If you’re that gambling degenerate, you will lose

Me personally, I’m young but I move old school. I typically try to stay away from options as much as possible. Too much nonsense can happen either way

If you don’t care about lighting the money on fire it could be an interesting way to go long but I’d still prefer common or even leverage shares

Leaps are probably your best choice"

2025-09-09,"It’s simply not enough time to be confident. You might win, you might lose; it’s essentially gambling. If you want leverage via call options, a much higher-percentage strategy is to buy longer-dated options, such as ones expiring 1-2 years from now. That way, it’s less a short-term market-timing gamble and more a bet on earnings beats over the coming 4-8 quarters."
2025-09-09,How do you feel about put credit spreads
2025-09-09,"They’re one of the safer options choices but the problem with options is that limiting your losses also limits your gains. 

I think the safest options are covered calls or long term leaps"
2025-09-08,"AI is like the industrial revolution and will allow for much more work to be done by fewer number of people. And the businesses, especially the big money love that. Unexpectedly though, it came for the creative jobs, arts first. But make no mistake, robotics is the next step. For industrial production, agriculture and for household tasks, there is great need for automated robots. When Jensen said that everything that moves will be robotic, he wasn't wrong. There is no way around it. Why pay $30K/year to a seasonal farm worker when you can buy a $100K robot that can work day and night throughout the year and run it for 20 years.

In the middle of all this, is Nvidia, supplying the hardware that powers the LLMs, AI agents, self driving cars and next the robots. We've only seen the LLMs actualize so far, and full self driving in early stages (Mercedes and BYD, not Tesla), which was enough to push the revenue over $150B/year with a high gross margin. I don't think anyone knows how much revenue the self driving and robotics will generate since those chips are easier to create, hence the competitors have a better chance but I see Nvidia doing all the right moves to hook developers into their ecosystem."
2025-09-08,"for myself it's Jensen Huang's vision. I saw an interview of Jensen with Cleo Abram some months ago just after tariff, I have a strong urge to support what he's trying to do, robotic field, AI, chip development, hardware software application, CUDA core (amd slowly catching up with their *ROCm*). Also I play pc games as hobby, own pretty much every gen of nvdia gpu. Might as well put my cash in it and generates wealth

Now my average price is 135, still adding more when it dips just last week 168"
2025-09-08,"There are other companies, but NVDA is leading the pack by far. They also have a moat with their CUDA software which means once a company buys NVDA chips, it’s very expensive for that company to switch to AMD later - which means they’re likely to stay with NVDA for the long term. That means they’re a repeat customer. 

NVDA makes such advanced chips that China is literally smuggling them in through the black market because they can’t make chips as good as NVDA. Tesla was making their own and recently threw up their hands and decided to use NVDA chips instead. 

So, it’s sticky business with repeat customers that are very unlikely to switch, and they provide the best product. Even if AMD somehow surpassed NVDA and make better chips (very unlikely), companies will still likely use NVDA because of how sticky they are with the CUDA software. As I said, it’ll be very expensive for a business to switch, so in this scenario AMD would have to be WAAAYYY better for a company to justify the switching cost. Again, very very unlikely 

NVDA chips are and will be used for AI datacenters, LLMs like ChatGPT, Tesla autonomous driving, and humanoid robotics. Basically anything that uses AI will be using NVDA. 

CDNS is a great company as well with great financials. Their only competitor is SYNS but CDNS typically performs better. They’re the ones who design and test the chips - it’s an essential business and step 1.

Step 2 is Taiwan semiconductor (TSM). They’re the foundry that actually makes the base of the chips. They also have virtually no competition. 

Step 3 is NVDA. 

Step 4 is the application of these chips. Datacenters, LLMs, Tesla, etc. 

I like investing in companies with strong financials and little to no competition. So I invest in CDNS, TSM, NVDA, TSLA, and PLTR"
2025-09-09,"It is if you believe that we’re on the edge of a huge revolution. And I’m not talking about actual LLMs, that’s just the tip of the iceberg, a “free” training for the real market. I’m talking about robotics, spatial, cars, health, job automation… I do believe that NVDA is working on these future market. 

But don’t forget that a lot of good companies with great vision failed in the past, or been replaced with other companies. NVDA leadership might change but for now, it remains a good (the best?) option to follow this revolution"
2025-09-08,"Before  AI booming around 2015, I remember that I was looking to buy gaming computer. At that time, everyone was suggesting me that card should be nvidia. I did not realize it was good opportunity to buy as stock"
2025-09-08,"It’s not always a good buy necessarily. Buying it at a fair price is always good, however. I use Morningstar and other analysts to decide what’s a fair price. But to answer your question they sell the “picks and shovels” of the AI “gold rush”.  GPUs perform massive matrix calculations in parallel and LLMs like ChatGPT are composed entirely of matrices. To run them they need tons of calculations performed and NVIDIA has captured this market through GPUs and their CUDA software that efficiently processes Python and C++ code on GPUs. Without CUDA and without GPUs, it would take forever to train and to generate text outputs from systems like Gemini and ChatGPT."
2025-09-09,Everyone loves to talk about how they would have invested in pick axes during the gold rush. NVDA is the modern version of that.
2025-09-09,"It isn’t always good to buy. 

If you don’t do research you shouldn’t buy stocks."
2025-09-09,It wasn't a good buy at $183.
2025-09-09,"First, Nvidia is *not* ""always good to buy."" In fact, one could argue now is *not* a good time to buy until NVDA can prove that it is not breaking down.

That said, the reason Nvidia is the elite market leader is because the chips they create are better than any other chips for the computing power required by AI. They have a practical monopoly in the space because no other chips perform as well and the Nvidia software is entrenched in the industry.

If you believe AI has a big future, then Nvidia is likely to continue its growth as more and more power is required for increasingly complex AI-based applications.

However, at some point, the market will be saturated with their chips and companies will not need to buy them anymore at the torrid pace they are doing now. At that time, nobody knows when but it will come, Nvidia stock will likely have a large drop. However, for all we know the stock will be $250 before that happens."

2025-09-08,"If you invested $10,000 in NVDA 10 years ago it would be worth $3.2 million today"
2025-09-08,"When adjusting for annual inflation over the past 10 years, the value of an S&P 500 investment would be less than the nominal $33,736.4 stated in the image, but still much higher than the original $10,000. The real (inflation-adjusted) annualized return of the S&P 500, including dividends, is about **9.2%** over the last decade.

# Inflation Impact on Returns

* Average US inflation rates from 2015 to 2025 ranged from about 0.1% to 8% per year.

* While the S&P 500's nominal 10-year annualized return is around **13.2%**, real returns (after inflation) drop to about **9.2%** per year.

# Inflation-Adjusted Growth

* Based on the real annualized return, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 10 years ago would now be worth approximately **$24,100** after adjusting for inflation, not $33,736.4.

* The figure in the image reflects nominal growth, which does not consider loss of purchasing power due to inflation.

# Interpretation

* **Nominal return:** $10,000 → $33,736.4 over 10 years.

* **Real return (inflation-adjusted):** $10,000 → \~**$24,100** over 10 years.
* The image's statement should be interpreted as showing the growth in dollar terms, but not the ""real"" increase in purchasing power. After inflation, the actual gain is smaller, though still substantial."

2025-09-10,"Ahh yes, and after a nice capital gains tax of 42% and 30% inflation, your returns would be a nice 5.5% annualized after infltion and tax.

2025-09-09,Why ? You literally 3x your portfolio buying the S&P500 etf in 10 years with no extra work.
2025-09-08,"Is SP500 outpacing inflation and does it outperform more ""traditional"" investments?"
2025-09-08,No. We would be poor due to perfect  price discovery.
2025-09-10,because if you wouldve simply bought any of the top stocks in the s and P you woudlve did that 50x fuck an etf I buy btc
2025-09-12,"Because once the $10k is “worth” $33k after 10 years, the value of the dollar has dropped 7-8% each year. So that $33k is actually losing money. Put another way, if it costed $10k to buy a car 10 years ago, today the growth of that $10k in the S&P wouldn’t even buy you the same car today."
2025-09-10,this guy econs… except in reality we wouldnt be poor we just wouldnt be rich. if we all had crystal balls and perfect price discovery our returns would be exactly equal to the earnings growth of the company… although not sure what the effects of having a crystal ball and knowing what that growth will be are
2025-09-14,Bro invests and thinks a 3x in 10 years is worth something in relation to the $ decreasing + inflation maybe if it was 6 figs tho loooooool

OKLO, IONQ, RKLB to name a decent one from each sector, but I wouldn't bank on any one of them shooting the moon, it's best to have a couple from each sector so that when one of those spaces does eventually blow up, you own the winner."

2025-09-10,Any compainies they invest in.
2025-09-08,"depends what you mean by ""alternatives""   most people in the thread are responding with other stocks in the semiconductors sector.

SCHD could be a great alternative because it provides a fantastic diversification to compliment a monster growth stock like NVDA.  

If u want to own the broader semiconductor sector without stock picking go with SMH."
2025-09-08,"Intel is a dark horse pick, but i think they are about to get aggressive in the AI space. Price to sales is 2 vs 40 for Nvidia."

2025-09-08,Do you think MRVL do well next earnings?
2025-09-08,"Recency bias, GOOG has been a screaming buy for months. Personally I don't like buying AVGO at this moment in time AT ALL. They mooned from news of a $10B+ contract from OpenAI which doesn't have the funding yet, MSFT isn't going to dump to them forever"
2025-09-08,"This is the right answer. 

The question OP asked could be rewritten as, what company isn't as good as NVDA that I could put my money into in hopes that the inferior company will do the same thing."
2025-09-08,Lmao yeah a 300B dollar company with billions in DC revenue is non existent… wise up
2025-09-08,"I see you like to buy high sell low.

You know Nvidia dropped to $100 only a few months ago right?"
2025-09-08,Yes the AMD that was once valued at 195 can currently be purchased for 149$

All I’m saying is that quantum computing will absolutely be a thing eventually, so why not put a few speculative dollars into the sector?  If not companies like IONQ or even RGTI/QBTS, one could also get some pseudo-quantum exposure by investing in cybersecurity companies who are developing QC-resistant encryption methods, because you know companies will at least be forced to jump on that eventually."

Unless AI gets another rally like the beginning of August"
2025-09-09,"Lol. I hear you on valuation. But still, you won't get as good of a company as NVDA and most likely pay more in terms of P/E. But oh well. Value hunters are value hunters, no shame in that."
2025-09-08,Except AVGO isn’t a competitor… you can talk when the MI355 racks numbers are reported and when MI400 is in production
2025-09-08,You buy more
2025-09-08,Great forming of a sentence there mate lol. They have projected tens of billions on revenue this year so will see a good run up after earnings is my guess

Now the dilemma 
1. September 19 is triple witching  when the stock price all across is down, hedge funds are selling, and option premium can fall down to even IV 35%. So I want to hold till that time to buy.
2. FOMC rate Cut  is coming, so that dip may not happen  as expected on the triple witching Friday , and the prize may actually go up.
So I’m going to watch this week and if by any luck, we get down to between 155 and 160, I might buyers  forget about it"
2025-09-08,"I meant if the stock price falls to 155 to 160, I will definitely buy leaps as mentioned above"

2025-09-07,Retail buying more than $900 million into Nvidia last week shows how powerful individual investors have become in smoothing out sharp sell offs. Hedge funds were net sellers during the same period.
2025-09-08,"What are you even saying? You didn't sell at the high for NVIDIA? If not you're holding long-term then why do you care about the short-term noise?

This is a dumb post, math isn't hard

Anyone with half a brain would want to take profits at a high, and reinvest when it's advantageous at a lower level 🤷‍♂️"

2025-09-07,Probably 50%. 40% into sgov as my saving account.  Going to sell some each quarter since it seems there's a run up at earning then a dip. I pulled out of most of my positions at other companies so going to wait a bit before coming back in
2025-09-07,Buy more NVDA or Hood?
2025-09-07,"I'm 65 thinking about retiring in a couple years I am very heavy tech with the exception of my money market money and people are telling me to actually sell my Nvidia and I also have overlapping of ETS with the magnificent seven guess it goes up. It goes down, but it's been pretty good to me so I truly would love to know peoples thoughts I really will feel very sad if I have to leave those positions."
2025-09-07,Used to be 20%. Reduced it to 10% the day before Q2 earnings. Now it’s 5%.
2025-09-07,Difficult to say because NVDA is the top holding in several ETFs that I own. I'd estimate  \~10%
2025-09-08,"about 20% total between TFSA and RRSP combined. Vast majority of the rest is in XEQT. The only reason I went heavier on NVDA is because of the april dip, it was intended to be a short-medium term hold. Now I am just not sure when I should sell."
2025-09-08,50% but I entered in 2016 and 2017 and have been selling down from 85%
2025-09-08,44% right now. I recently sold a bit at $175 to diversify.

They say diversification is for amateurs. I'm an amateur, and I'm not so poor anymore to risk everything on one stonk. 

I'd also be surprised if NVDA did significantly better than an index at this point."

2025-09-08,"Diversification. NVIDIA is my largest single holding. I feel very bullish on them, so may go to 5%. Have held it since 2021. No single stock should ever be more than 10%. I diversified between Large cap, small cap, tech, international, gold, some bonds, etc. even the S&P index by itself is not a good diversification due to the huge influence of the mag7.

2025-09-09,"
100%. Nvidia’s ecosystem will only grow stronger and expand wider. And as we go farther in the years, the higher likelihood nvidia will have to sell to china again. Nvidia literally is AI. If they don’t beat the S&P then there was a crash or cyberattack that made them flop. And even if they do, just buy again during that period and I’m sure they’ll beat the S&P"
2025-09-08,Let the man speak. (I’m trying to get fired.)
2025-09-07,"Difficult to say. I bought first on liberation day, but I was at the time testing many stocks so I sold all my positions and did a stock rotation. By the time I have had Palantir, Google, Amazon and in none of these I could sleep well. Then I sold everything and bought Nvidia back again recently and it fell, but I'm okay with it.

2025-09-08,"lol you do realize the past has absolutely nothing to do with the future, right?

GE beat the SP500 for 20 years straight. And then it never recovered again after 2008 

The mag7 may falter, but the SP500 will simply rebalance and keep chugging. 

At this point, the amount of extra single stock risk you're taking by going into a mag7 doesn't make it worthwhile over an index IMHO. If you're gonna take that risk, find something that can provide significant outperformance, not just a marginal gain at best"
2025-09-08,"Lol, you dont have a clue. Sell all your mag 7, cause Proctor and gamble is gonna outperform for 5 years....

The index can not outperform any of its heaviest weightings.

2025-09-08,"lol where did P&G come from? 

You realize that weightings in the index change constantly, right? 

Here's a scenario for you to ponder: 

A valuation crunch event for the mag7 drops them hard. Index drops too, ofc

But now the market decides growth & tech are out of favour. Too expensive. Reversion to the mean. Value is back in.

In this environment, Mag7 may not recover for 5+ years. Index probably will recover because the weightings change automatically to the stocks that are doing better. Index outperforms for the next 5 years. 

Investing 101 🤷🏽‍♂️"

Msft googl aapl nvda etc are going to outperform the index.

Indexes give you an ""average"" return of maybe 7% a year.
Pompous people like yourself have made this argument for the last 20 years and all along all my single stocks have continually outperformed the sp500 after 5 years.

If what you were saying was true, then everyone would sell all their msft googl and nvda cause they wouldn't think those positions were worth holding.

Again, ive outperformed the sp500 by miles for over 15 years now and haven't done it by holding an index!...."

Listen, I'm happy for your success. I too have beaten the index with individual picks like NVDA. A lot of people have beaten the index over the last 15 years. It's been the mother of all bull runs. Everyone is a genius in a bull market. 

I do suggest you find some humility though, or the market will humble you on its own. 

FWIW, I don't think the mag7 will necessarily underperform the index in the short term, I just don't think they'll grow fast enough now to warrant the uncompensated risk of holding them individually. You do you though 😋"

Whether thats this week or three weeks from now I imagine we will see a resurgence soon. Had the same theory with Walmart and paid off greatly
2025-09-07,"Just my two cents:

* The run from 140\~184, shooting pass previous sticky ATH at 154, with barely any resistance, came from Nvidia being awarded the license to resell H20 in the CN market, albeit 15% revenue share with the US Gov, after the April complete ban. However, that sentiment is shaky now, with the CN Gov publicly discouraging the use of Nvidia hardware, Nvidia halting H20 production, and Alibaba's recent success story in homegrown hardware.
* The Broadcom recent success story, including the partnership with OpenAI for their own homegrown alternative to Nvidia.
* The deceleration of Data Centre infrastructure, evident in earnings reports from both Nvidia and Dell.

Yes, I believe Nvidia will eventually reach the 200+ strike, but in the near term, 130\~145 feels like the fair value Buy range personally, anything above that is more of a Hold + fixed mini DCA bi-weekly play for myself."

2025-09-07,Less than it is now bc I shorted it
2025-09-07,"Right now $210, in 5 years $450"
2025-09-07,"There is no real way to predict the real worth, no matter the crazy estimates. Here is why: the assumption now is that there will be 3-4 trillion if not more spent for AI in next 5 years. If Nvidia successfully generates 100-150B$ profits per year by maintaining the 70%+ margin, then there is a thesis for 150-200$ for next years. Now, reality is that for the same price you can buy 2-3x more computing power from AMD/Intel. If you can utilize that computing power efficiently, then you eat up from Nvidia's market share and force them to drop the price. That would then make Nvidia worth 50 to 100$. If suddenly companies like Cerebras take off, those will kill heavily the profit margins of Nvidia, because a Cerebras chip is replacing tens of Nvidia GPUs and can run way larger models. In this case, you see Nvidia at 20-30$ at most. If light computing catches on, and there are more and more developments in this field, like doing matrix multiplications using light, then you have a chip that can replace 100 Nvidia GPUs while using 1/1000 the power. This alone makes GPUs obsolete and retire them from datacenters back to gaming. That would move Nvidia back to 5-10$ if this happens. So you can see that there are many unknowns when it comes to market. The Nvidia argument is that it's years ahead of competition due to software. But reality is that today there are better solutions already, like Cerebras. And due to the power hungry nature of the chips and the prospect of accelerating compute by 100-1000 times using light, this is heavily researched now. If this takes off, it's just game over for Nvidia. The big companies would definitely choose a chip that gives them 1000 times more compute for a fraction of the power, because that allows them to scale up the software without the provisioning of GW of power for datacenters. 

Nvidia has definitely big threats. So for next 5 years the price can be anywhere between 5 and 200$ depending on how they deal with the threats. For example, they could invest all their profits in buying and developing further Cerebras. That would definitely keep them at 200$. Or they could pump all their profits in light computing research and be the ones who are deploying the first AI accelerators using light, again staying at 200$ instead of falling into obsolence. And while staying with GPUs, they could pump their profits in buying Intel for their fabs, pump their fabs division and ensure the profits stay high. That again could keep Nvidia to 200$."

2025-09-06,"People are so retarded with their reactions to this news. OpenAI needs MORE chips than NVDA can sell them, they’ll take them from wherever they can get. How is this a bad thing?"
2025-09-07,"My humble 2 cents observation.

Companies that come up with their own AI chips do so for few reasons. Huge capital. Less reliance on Nvidia. Skip the Q and get alternative chips faster. But the most important reason is this: design the AI chips for power efficiency with high memory bandwidth. Why? To lower the cost per token. Microsoft, Meta, AWS and Google etc ultimately need to get a return on their huge AI investments. They bill their customers for inference uses. Their in-house chips are meant for inference uses. For training large models, they still depend on Nvidia chips. Nvidia chips are too powerful and costly for inference uses. Most companies buy them for training purposes. And training large model is cyclical, especially when there are new information or fine tuning is needed as and when. So there is still some use for Nvidia chips.

AMD should be worried. They are behind Nvidia on hardware and even further behind on software (CUDA). They know they cannot overtake Nvidia, so they can only offer a cheaper option to customers. Ultimately, Nvidia is the choice for training models. But interestingly for inference, AMD chips start to look more attractive due to the high memory bandwidth offered, and at lower price. That is where they really wanted to gain the market share as it is more feasible. But lo and behold, the big AI players are building their own inference AI chips. Where does that leave AMD? Their customers would likely be smaller AI players and hence much smaller market share than they anticipated.

It is also good to know that Nvidia is no longer “selling chips”. They are repositioning as AI infrastructure sellers. When customers buy Nvidia, they are also getting the AI infrastructure support end to end."

2025-09-06,"Processors come with a natural economic moot. Once a processor reaches maturity say for example X86 processors like Intel and AMD, people would have written a crap ton of software and libraries optimized for that architecture using the instruction set of that processor. Plenty of open source software is written by volunteers who are not paid money for their contributions. Corporations also contribute to OSS but only if they see an economic value in doing so.

Nvidia's CUDA has an established moot. That is the thing upon which all of the modern machine learning libraries are built upon.

And the instruction set of a processor is proprietary(Unless it is something like RISC-V ofcourse). You are not allowed to build processors that use that proprietary instruction set.

Even if you get around the legal loophole(For example there is no IP protection for these processors in China) you still have to reverse engineer the processor to figure out how exactly the instruction set is implemented. AMD did this for nearly 2 decades and it was a nightmare for them. Processors are intentionally designed to make reverse engineering them as difficult as possible."

2025-09-06,The ironic thing I’ve noticed is that everyone seems to think Nvidia is all GPU and done. It’s prepackaged software and the networking required for all the magic to work has a revenue stream that just gets bigger and bigger with every Blackwell sold.

As long as this stock is between 165-185 it is in a constructive longer-term consolidation. If it should lose 165 for more than a few days, it is highly likely the prior all-time high around 153 will be tested. If that should be lost, we're likely headed to the 140's.

AI may follow a similar trajectory. Eventually, chips made by other companies will be competitive and the CUDA moat will fade as software engineering evolves. NVDA may well find other markets to continue their torrid growth, like robotics, but that remains to be seen.

So, while I think NVDA at $200 by next year is a very high probability scenario, what happens 2+ years from now is more uncertain. At some point, the hyperscalers will stop their big spending and NVDA growth will slow, and the stock will take a big hit.

The good news is, there will be newly minted leaders that will take the reins, just like the Internet birthed Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and many other elite companies. And we’ll be able to get in on these names in the very early innings."

Don't know what happened to it though. 

My Cousin started his own company when he was still in HS. Something about hosting sites and he'd write algorithms so that your company would show up on Google. This seems unlikely to me but whatever, by College, he sold his company for 8M. 

He was one of the top Wrestling recruits in the Country, full scholarship, ended up transferring back home, then quit. He DID end up running doing something for the University he was at, their Athletic Department, then for a couple sports apparel companies and then hosted a bunch of forums and... whatever.

  
But he was telling me about BTC. He swore it'd be huge. He got cancer though. So started in his spine, spread. He went to Mexico to get these Stem cell treatments, went to Mexico. He told me he'd put 10K into BTC and asked if I wanted to put money into it, he'd do it for me. I didn't obviously.

  
But now it's about 2016 and the treatment didn't work, last time I talked to him he was saying he's gotta get  everything together and write it out for his wife(who was pregnant). How she didn't know anything about the money. Well, he did very suddenly at THAT point. He thought he had a few months, he was dead a couple days after I spoke with him. 

  
Last I heard was his wife was arguing with his Brother about his Crypto Wallet and who had the password and my cousin bought a boat so she assumed he found it(he would have trusted his Brother with it, but my his Brother also spent 20 years in the Navy and retired a commander, so he would have 100% given the money to her had he ""found"" it). 

  
Anyway, he either sold to fund the treatments or... maybe it's just out there and he never got around to passing it on to his wife."
2025-09-06,"Yeah even if you studied the same things as the CEO and even master everything about Nvidia hardware itself, it’s still better to be a janitor 20 years ago and have invested in Nvidia"
2025-09-05,10 year covered call paid good
2025-09-06,"Also, why buy Nvidia if you can teleport? Just go back to pre first Bitcoin rally and buy at $50 and sell at $17k lol"
2025-09-06,"I have a large lot of shares ive owned since nvidia was in the teens. Its a big part of my retirement. Only problem is inflation and everything else that threatens it. I still have at least 20 years before retirement age. The other problem is all the other investments that didn't pan out. You still have to factor that into these ""what if"" scenarios. What if I put ALL my money into it? Ya..."
2025-09-07,$HOOD. Thank me later.
2025-09-08,For a 300x return it wod need to be $30T market cap
2025-09-08,"I had a coworker that said he sold his in college for like $1k, 15+ years ago. He said it would have been $30M today. Whoopsies"
2025-09-05,i was only kidding.  my dumb ass bought 350 shares of intel about a month ago.  it hasnt really moved.  Probably going to dump it again.
2025-09-06,"It’s a hard problem to answer cus it’s still speculative. But when you think about where the world is in the next 10 years or 5, it’s going to be changed by AI. It’s in the government’s best interest to “beat china” in this race. Nvidia will have the monopoly because of how ahead they are the ecosystem surrounding their gpus being so strong. I see today’s price as a discount for a company that will have increases over the next 2 years for sure and then plateau for a bit with a slight squeeze"
2025-09-08,I never thought of owning shares in robinhood and I use it everyday. Thanks for reminding me to buy some Monday.
2025-09-08,"True. I’m not arguing for a 300x return on Robinhood over the next decade. That’s dumb. But it’s a good 10x opportunity over the next decade. So you can decide for yourself if that’s “good enough”. For me, it is. $10k -> $100k is solid."
2025-09-05,"Don't feel bad. A lot of people fell for Intel. I bought 10 30c the day that they got the government contract and actually made money on Intel for the first time ever. I sold all but one contract. I decided to keep one runner. Unfortunately, it was the slow one that is now running backward."
2025-09-05,Bad move. jmho
2025-09-05,"Maybe so, but if you look. Bit further back, there is 15 years of no real growth. AMD had over 20 of potentially losses.
Yes it's exploded now, but no guarantee that they keep climbing like crazy.

People were buying more pcs, more consoles, more people played video games, but there wasn't that much growth. At some point, AI will hit same saturation. Maybe that's 5 years still in the future."
2025-09-07,Buy more. If you are asking for what to buy then this is the one.
2025-09-05,"Because only recently there is a huge growth in need for computing power. Everything is online now, everything is going to need AI, as of right now Nvidia is leader in the market and will probably be for some time. I expect a good amount of growth in the upcoming years AI will be more then standard"
2025-09-07,"On Nvidia Stock Page , what are you doing here also 4 bucks this guy is a Reddit Troll , Good one man 💀"
2025-09-05,"Those inflows being at the 90th percentile scream momentum, but also caution — when positioning is this crowded, reversals hit fast. NVDA’s fine as long as liquidity holds, but trim into strength instead of chasing. Liquidity cuts both ways."

2025-09-04,"Sell everything. 

Long build a bear."
2025-09-05,lol it was $85 just 5 months ago!!!!!!!!!!
2025-09-04,"No, this month utterly sucks for tech and most stocks other than bank stocks / financials. I would wait, it’s going to get messy with the unemployment rate data releasing tomorrow and the issues with the Fed and inflation. Also china is mad at NVDA for selling fourth-rate quality chips and now BABA is a real competitor.  Be aware for September. October looks better"
2025-09-04,"I mean I’m in at 270,000 at an average price of 173.50 so yeah"
2025-09-04,"The current bear thesis is 1.) it's going down because it's Sept. 2.) its going down because it's not going up.

If you're long here i would not be worried"
2025-09-04,"Just adding that nvidia did not ""crush"" earnings, they crushed earnings last period but this one it was basically right where expected, just a little bit over the EEPS. No one can know where the market will 100% go, only think where it'll go. I mean trump could say one word and either make the stock tank or pump up like crazy."
2025-09-05,"Buying opportunity, don’t forget it dropped below $100 in April then hit over $186. Buy now, reap the rewards into the 4th quarter."
2025-09-04,"Market movers taking profits, waiting for another buy-in point, ‘cause they know it’s gonna run again. In simple terms, this is how it’s done."
2025-09-04,I called it I said they would crush earnings and be down about 10%.
2025-09-05,It means a good time to buy more
2025-09-05,"I don’t like the risk buying it at 170. 
FOMO is real.  


While I don’t think NVDA will fall too far I just think it has more downside than ppl often think at this market cap and is 100% priced for perfection 

But I would buy it and not lose too much sleep"
2025-09-05,"It’s all been priced in for a while now, what don’t you get?"
2025-09-05,"It is a disappointing stock right now. Sold a bunch of AVGO at 249 a couple mos ago to invest in it, and what a mistake that was."
2025-09-05,Or nvidia doubled in the 3 months ahead of crushing earnings
2025-09-05,"What a massive collection of long-winded nonsense about Nvidia written by people that have absolutely no idea what they're talking about, nor do they have any concept about the power behind and the future of Nvidia.

Those that fail to load their vault with Nvidia now will be labeled as complete NVIDIOTS two to three years from now. Oh how the internet with a few strokes of a keyboard can showcase the dumb and dumber."
2025-09-05,RSI=45 is Not Oversold! It’s if RSI gets to 70 then it should be considered Oversold… your assumptions are off…
2025-09-05,I would wait for the stock to retest the previous ath at 152. It's possible to buy in between 140-150 in Sep
2025-09-05,So when do I sell
2025-09-05,Buy 137-147 next year 225
2025-09-06,My target is 130-140 when I will jump back in.
2025-09-04,"Sold before earnings at 181, waiting to hit 150’s before reevaluating"
2025-09-05,"Its just a normal pullback and is healthy. You want strong traders in, not just people chasing momentum. Bottom is $160 btw, above the $150-155 deepseek highs in January. If it gets to the $150s, back the truck up"
2025-09-05,"And they also didn’t crush earnings… they beat top and bottom, but it wasn’t 56.5bn like the street wanted."
2025-09-05,Why do you believe that's not all priced in?
2025-09-04,Bruh show proof.  I want to see a whale in real reddit life.
2025-09-04,"Yo put the dick away damn 🤣🤣 i got 6.5 shares lmao 

I like to say its not a race though, I just started almost 2 years ago,"
2025-09-04,But high sell low?
2025-09-05,You bought my shares
2025-09-04,‘Right where they expected’ was to crush earnings lol
2025-09-04,"I pay a lot more attention to PEG ratios.  Which accounts for how much premium you are paying for a company's growth.

A number under 1 is very good for the amount of growth NVDA has."

2025-09-05,The fear is priced in but the next few weeks might create more fear as recession headlines and Fed tensions grow

2025-09-04,"I have a stop loss and no one knows the future, one bit of china news and this thing is past 180"
2025-09-05,Maybe they mean 270k shares and not $270k.
2025-09-05,Was it 270K shares or 270K dollars
2025-09-05,"Or the opposite effect.  I’m not a bear, but I see storm clouds.  I’d get a raincoat just in case. This month will definitely test the strength of this economy and markets"
2025-09-05,"$270,000 dollars. I was disappointed too"
2025-09-05,"It does seem implausible that someone would have almost $50 million worth of shares would be shit-posting on Reddit. Also that seems an improbably high average price for such a large holding.

Who knows though; I'm a minnow and know not the ways of the whales."
2025-09-09,Doubtful someone with that kind of liquidity has the time or inclination to shit post on Reddit.

2025-09-04,"Haha love the energy, but remember NVDA moves with semis + macro risk-on flows, not just vibes. Futures being green doesn’t guarantee we close green. Trade the levels, not the hype."
2025-09-04,"Good job, your post has Clifford cocked us back to flat 👍🏻"
2025-09-04,He can't stop otherwise his futes go red.   In fact if I were you I'd volunteer a finger or two - just take one for the team. 😂😂
2025-09-03,145 was such a ball breaker to get through that it is almost inevitable as a target for support - no?  I would definitely see it as an opportunity.
2025-09-03,228 shares @ $101 and I’m holding long
2025-09-03,I added a bit yesterday when it dropped to the $160’s. I’ll add more if it goes to $150’s and anything below that I’m buying heavy. My current average is $78. I wouldn’t mind averaging up to $100
2025-09-03,I remember just 4/5 months ago. We had the same discussion but talking about if it was going up or below $100. These guys just keep waiting for the right time and the price keeps increasing.
2025-09-03,Already loaded 500 shares at $96
2025-09-03,Nvidia is a powerhouse. My recommendation is buy when you can afford to buy.
2025-09-03,"I’m exhausted mentally from the good news followed by bad news followed by good news. The drag getting past $140 was a pain in the a$$. NVDA seems to just have stalled from any further substantial price improvement and I don’t know wtf to do. They give exceptional outlook and beat on earnings, another buy back, and then sinks, always. Today so many others green, not NVDA. Went in with $340K last June at $136."
2025-09-03,I am so close to all in. The cash I have will last for many yrs. I will leave all my shares alone for many years to come. I have no need for that money.
2025-09-03,"If you are looking to buy and hold for long term, then now seems to be a good opportunity. Wait to see if it goes lower? Of course it can, but then you are playing the 'time the market game'. 155 seems a long stretch at these levels."
2025-09-04,Friday and today- 169 is an amazing buy
2025-09-03,"My position was at $39 pre split, doesn’t really seem to make sense to add"
2025-09-04,"Most of my positions that i added after split was around $100-120 range, but i pretty much all out of NVDA now besides a very small portion after it hit 170. Waiting for a correction if it ever corrects, if not ill just try to find another gem"
2025-09-04,Nvdl at 33.95. We won't see april prices again.
2025-09-04,my boats already over 50% loaded. i still think it is undervalued. i place a value around 270.
2025-09-04,$74
2025-09-04,"Just cashed out of all my high yield dividend ETFs and put another $25k into NVDA at $178. Majority bought at mid 90s, and 130s. Totaling just over 800 shares now. Plan to sell off about 25% at the $250 mark."
2025-09-04,Buy more before it goes above 180 again.
2025-09-04,I hope 100$
2025-09-04,I trimmed about 15% as it seems to be rolling over and can't hold the 50 day ma. Also trimmed 25% of my Google and Iren shares. Sold my full position on atat and have been adding to reddit and Netflix. I feel a little September swoon coming. Market has been great good luck 🍀 to all!
2025-09-05,I loaded the boat and have over 3100 shares with a cost basis of $24.77
2025-09-05,I’ll load up after tomorrows dismal jobs report.
2025-09-05,I got in at 15 bucks a share with 50 shares I’m sitting for a bit too lol
2025-09-04,"Same, holding out for 150 - 155"
2025-09-04,Also worried that it won’t be this price again after September tbh
2025-09-03,"Great question! Only you know your real reason beyond profit, but set a clear goal—debt, home, retirement. Once you hit it, you’ve won. Nvidia is a once-in-a-lifetime stock."
2025-09-04,Yeah but September is historically bad month for stocks so we may be able to bottom tick this month at some point
2025-09-04,"Because its a 4 trillion dollar company that just announced earnings. Earnings were great just need time for the market to digest and settle in. 5% a day for a 4 trillion dollar company is 200 billion in MC growth, wallst has never seen something like this"
2025-09-04,Waiting for the low to buy in more snd see the growth after sep
2025-09-03,"Hold, good start."
2025-09-04,Make it a 100 shares.
2025-09-04,"I think it’s a good entry price, do it! If you wait it’ll probably go up and right now it’s below what Morningstar would consider FMV ($190)."
2025-09-04,Yes and hold until 200+
2025-09-07,Buy 137-147
2025-09-04,Good start
2025-09-04,Good idea
2025-09-04,Buy an option that expires Sept 19. Bank at the least 40% of your investment.
2025-09-06,I’m from the future. I’d say hold off till September 5th. Should drop to around 165.
2025-09-03,Buy?
2025-09-03,"Don't need in near future, long term investment perspective.."
2025-09-04,Hold for a decade
2025-09-03,Buy as much as possible.
2025-09-03,Buy Nvidia and don't think anymore
2025-09-03,You ok u/apooroldinvestor? You didn't mention your $45 million ready to be deployed today.
2025-09-03,Guys watch it turn red
2025-09-03,Supposedly they have a 60 billion dollar buyback who knows when that will be
2025-09-03,"Hold for now. You have time. 
An example of what I just went through. I had a 3  week put on spy for 638 that would end on sept 5th. 
You saw how the market was behaving since Jackson hole. I got walloped. At one point I was down 14k with only 2k value. Then last Friday brought a little relief, I could have sold at less of a loss… but I kept holding because I had time. Because of today’s drop I made it all back and more. 

The beauty of the long game and all this volatility is it will bounce back. Give it some time."
2025-09-03,"Feb ’26 calls at $170 aren’t dead, but you need to think in terms of implied vol and catalysts. NVDA’s still riding AI momentum, but if earnings or macro cool off, those premiums will bleed hard. Scaling out partials keeps you in the game without going bagholder."
2025-09-06,"I mean, nobody KNOWS if/when it will hit $200. All anyone can do is speculate. That said, I'd guess September and first half of October are gonna be bumpy, but it should start gaining traction again by November and reach a new high by December. The question is, would it be smarter to hold for that, or cut losses now, use that money on something else to build back up, and rebuy the option early October? I'd personally ride it out, but that's just me."
2025-09-03,"NVDA could hit $200 before February 2026. It could also hit $87, or both or neither. You buy far OTM calls before earnings and think you will win? You gambled and the odds were not great. Everyone knew that shares were most likely to drop after earnings and everyone knew there would be an IV crush. It's a long time until February and hopefully you win big"
2025-09-03,No it won’t sell everything
2025-09-03,"If you purchased before earnings, you likely paid juiced premiums. Where is your breakeven?

While I certainly do not have a crystal ball, it would not surprise me if NVDA traded sideways to down over the next couple of months. If the market has a long awaited correction (which seems nearly impossible since every one-day dip is bought) then NVDA could go as low as 150-155. If the market does manage to have a real correction, the 140's is possible. Can you withstand that kind of volatility?

If it were me, I'd sell on a rally attempt that stalls prior to making a new all-time high and re-assess later."
2025-09-05,I wouldn’t hold any calls right now. It will tank before it goes back. If I did hold now. I wouldn’t sell until profitable again
2025-09-03,"I purchased the calls July 31st so it’s been a month of volatility lol. I’ve been up 2400$ and down 6k. Trust me the volatility I can deal with, it’s just the decay of the contract I’m trying to keep an eye on. Risk to reward is dwindling."
2025-09-03,That’s my exit strategy. I’m working on scaling out and don’t mind taking a 500-1000$ hit if I have too.
2025-09-04,reckon now is good time to buy? I got liquid  ?
2025-09-06,I strongly doubt it’ll go that low without some sort of catalyst to cause an overreaction. Selling Calls are super cheap right now so how are you making any money on them?
2025-09-03,"If your up 2400 before just sell and buy back in on a down day, rinse and repeat"
2025-09-03,"I respect your answer and the fact that you're monitoring theta 👍

As only a seller, my perspective is a bit skewed because your pain is my gain 🤷‍♂️

All I can say is if I were you I would have a realistic amount of gains of profit that I want to make with this specific position and open a limit order. 

Everything else is just kind of noise and stressful, you already made the choice to take on the risk but you still have the option to make the ride a bit easier if you simply define what you're willing to lose or gain 🤙"
2025-09-04,I believe between 165-185 there is no rush to buy this stock.
2025-09-06,"I know how it works, I was just saying the contract prices to sell covered calls in the short term are cheap so unless you have a shit load of shares it doesn’t seem worth it. Just my opinion though."
2025-09-04,"No idea if it ever will.

I can only assess what NVDA is currently doing. It has failed to break to new highs on earnings and instead fell back into its recent trading range. To me, this is a wait and see. The stock needs to build a new base. How it does that is anyone's guess. One possibility is a range-bound market between 165-185. Another is a pullback to re-test the prior high around 153. Another is a deeper pullback to the 140s. We cannot know what will happen, we can only plan for what might happen.

I would add NVDA if the market enters a correction and price is pulled back to the 140s. I would add NVDA if it falls back to the 150-155 area and then bounces. Otherwise, I would add when it breaks to new all-time highs.

If I had to guess, I'd say the most likely scenario is range-bound trading between 165-185 because it seems this market is unable to sustain any selling and might not give us a meaningful pullback."
2025-09-04,Good haha at least it gives us time to load up before we start seeing big green again
2025-09-04,"I agree, we have time. It seems unlikely NVDA will race back to new all-time highs quickly, though of course it is possible. We have many disappointed investors who bet on earnings and are losing money. They will likely provide overhead resistance as the stock climbs back near 185.

If I did not already have NVDA from much lower prices, I would consider accumulating around 165 if that area proves as support. But for now, I’m sitting tight. Sometimes, doing nothing is the right thing to do in the stock market."
2025-09-05,"Very good take bro, if you are already in a good position it doesn’t hurt to do nothing, I got an average price of 150 for nvidia, wish I didn’t have most my capital tied up in other assets when the tarrifs dropped bcuz I would’ve dumped alot of liquid into nvidia when it was $90. Something like nvidia was always bound to come back up let alone many other stocks"
2025-09-03,"If it was only, exclusively, Nvidia, I'd say something fucky is going on.

But everything shredded today, so it's just a regular Tuesday."

2025-09-03,"I believe nvda is overextended   
I sold and piled into SPY  
s&p500 is top heavy so im still decently exposed to nvda   
incase a bear market pullback happens   
nvda will likely drop 3x more than spy due to it's volatile nature   
then i pivot back into nvda   
actually im selling covered calls on spy as well  
that's about how confident i am that top is in   
but not confident enough to short."

2025-09-08,"maybe but i dont think it will happen now, this job report came to confirm rate cut this month as every1 pushing for it , the question is recession will happen after december cut means 2026 or before , i expect that another cut will happen december and this will be last bull rally chance then 2026 would hard market and recession chances will show clearly if it will happen or not"
2025-09-08,"So you think if someone is a long term holder, it’s best to wait to buy in for more till next year bcuz it will be a more bearish market and not so bullish?"
2025-09-02,People are selling their kidneys to buy Nvidia.
2025-09-02,You sell call when you already own the nvdia share. Do you mean selling cash secured puts to buy nvdia stock?
2025-09-03,He sold 2 covered calls and used the money to buy a few more NVDA shares. What’s the confusion?
2025-09-02,You mean selling puts?
2025-09-02,This guy is holding 1.5 shares at one of the brokers who allows partial shares.
2025-09-02,I sell covered calls on stock i already own.
2025-09-02,Or he can sell naked calls. I.e. he doesnt own any stocks
2025-09-03,And it limit the downside and the upside too.  It’s actually not a bad strategy if you want to sleep better.  It drop you keep your shares.  It climbs you make money.  I’m doing it too.
2025-09-03,"I always wondered about the ""90% of investors lose money"" rumour. Then realised that the average Joe is a dumbass that couldn't tell appart the market from a casino if his life depended on it. Is it that hard to buy and hold for +5 years? Easy fast money does no exist."
2025-09-03,I have 255 shares.now
2025-09-03,"Yeah, its called the wheel if you get assigned just sell cash secured puts or roll or just buy in again. 

With trump this is the best strategy because market can never rise to its full potential

Not an investment advice tho, do your dd"
2025-09-04,"You only do that when you’re willing to exit, not to hopefully avoid selling so you can buy more. Sell cash secured puts and use the premiums to buy more and if it falls you buy more at a discount"
2025-09-02,That's not a lot of shares. I bet some people in this sub own more
2025-09-04,"Following nvda for 10 years.
I think it’s on sale and I’m buying…"
2025-09-02,Why wouldn't there be a chance? You should just own shares for long term instead of gambling
2025-09-02,There's always a chance but your odds don't look good
2025-09-02,"Personally, I think there's a possibility that your calls could expire ITM but you're going to have to be patient. Now can some unprecedented event drag the price further down, sure, but this is still the post ER retraction. At 173 the buyers will eventually step in and go crazy."
2025-09-02,"lol you div!! Remember that the people who invest in companies like nvidia know a ton more than you think…. Companies find true value before results, same as a house sale it’s only worth what the next guy willing to pay. Your call was a bet that every investor was wrong and the results were gonna blow the knickers off of Wall Street…. You’re probably 18 qtrs late"
2025-09-02,"I'm right with you. Bought a long call, even though is well known not to do that (after earnings). Now I'm down like 50% (on that position). I'm gonna ride it till a week before expiry, so i can learn not to hope-gamble the market anymore. 

Taking the L and buying a call with a lower strike and longer expiry (IV is kinda low so extrinsic value is kind of cheap) would make more sense.

A cash secure put might work too, since I'm long with Nvidia."
2025-09-03,sell now at -50% or sell later at -99%. Theta is gonna get to it..
2025-09-02,"It’s been stuck at $180 for month, going down now. Check back later."
2025-09-02,Absolutely doable. Just needs some news catalyst. It’s been hype since July. Now it’s the bad news cycle and it will pop again
2025-09-02,There's a chance if you factor in the push from rate cuts. I think theta will have taken a toll on your options by then tho.
2025-09-02,You're playing w a wild card w this one. I believe in her long term but you never know wtf especially when you've got a president that plays games and does whatever he wants
2025-09-02,Not at all I have Buy orders in from 137–147 next year it will be 225
2025-09-02,"I think this stock is no good for options. Doesn’t follow any patterns and the more people keep hopes on it, the more it falls. Not talking about days like this."
2025-09-02,Honestly can't say as I have no idea how these gambles really work.  I just buy the stock.
2025-09-02,"Would need big new, major sector up, and fed cuts"
2025-09-02,But high sell low baby
2025-09-03,Sell the news
2025-09-03,Nop for the Short Term unless CEO clicks. MM getting the pots and pans out again —time to see who’s on the menu! 🍳📈
2025-09-02,You could strategize your initial bet to be 1/3rd of your total outlay giving you 3 total buy ins of the option. If drops 50% then buy the option down and maybe out to a later call date. Then if drops again triple down buying the strike down. The 3rd bet will save the others when all else fails. And if you don't have to buy down then great you won.  NVDA has been rallying post report lately so I like your position.
2025-09-02,You mean selling them and buying later expiry calls?
2025-09-04,"When you FOMO, and it happens + ER and depend on a 1/2 coin flip.

I am also a victim, thinking it will go past 182 and bought at the top 2x250c in 2 years' expiry on NVIDIA. Still down -16 ~ 20%. I did a very nice job averaging down when swing trading, buy low, sell high.

Since it's a 2-year LEAPS, I'm thinking of buying one more call now, doing swing trades and averaging down, or waiting for more dips opportunity."
2025-09-02,I've got $45 mil just waiting ....
2025-09-02,"Yea, my broker has an option where you select ""roll over"" and it lets you choose a date yourself. They auto sell and buy back for you."
2025-09-02,"sorry 3 day rule, don't touch a stock 3 days before and 3 days after earnings release."
2025-09-03,You can also change the strike price when you roll
2025-09-02,"Yes. It needed a correction. Don't sell. Buy the ""mini dip"". Wherever it goes, it will jump back up by EOY"
2025-09-02,"It has nothing to do with Nvidia guys. Whole market is down bc there is now doubt of a September rate cut. Moreover, September is a historically bad month. We better hope for a bad jobs report, and a rate cute, if not the whole market is in for a rough ride in short term. We’ll be fine by end of year."
2025-09-02,"That’s Nvidia for you, beat earnings and go down, nothing new"
2025-09-02,I hope so!!! So I can buy a ton more
2025-09-02,"Paper hands always lose. 

It’s a good buy opportunity. Their growth will no longer be stellar but it’s a safe hold. 

Absent a black swan, I doubt we’ll see prices like this again, altho it might continue to dip for a few weeks more. Tho I doubt that too. There’s a lot of shaking people out, across the board and in crypto too. Longs and shorts are getting wrecked. Stick to investing and not gambling"
2025-09-02,I’ll start accumulating below $162 if it ever gets there.
2025-09-02,Looks like buying opportunities all month!
2025-09-02,Time to buy!
2025-09-02,"Just normal dip, these stocks have ran a lot so not surprised they get sold now, part of the game. Buy more of good companies when they sellof"
2025-09-02,"Market will go down till we hear the employment report on Friday.  On that day, we’ll know which way to go."
2025-09-02,Sell in May and go away
2025-09-02,Argh shit. It's all the time the same I buy this shit. .... So I need to buy more and hold it until next year. Sorry everyone
2025-09-02,"Down it goes, sell I do now to keep profits!"
2025-09-02,"Don’t look at your portfolio in Sep, unless you have cash to buy more and in that case, bargain shop. For me, I’ll buy more S&P 500"
2025-09-02,September is the perfect month to buy. YTD is 20%+. Its normal to have a bit of a correction
2025-09-03,Probably because it’s valued at 4 Trillion. Who knows…
2025-09-03,Because they short it.
2025-09-04,"My limit order is set for $140, which I could move lower."
2025-09-05,Nvidia to $270!!!!!!!! Woooooooooo
2025-09-03,Let's take it to $140 please.
2025-09-02,Analysts are reading the earnings report and realising more than half the revenue comes from 3 clients.
2025-09-02,$90 soon
2025-09-02,Everything is red today!
2025-09-03,"September being bad is basically irrelevant at this point.

Lets just face facts, the administration is destroying the economy at a rapid pace. The tariffs blew up in their face and they keep going back and forth with china and nvda chips."
2025-09-02,"Genuine question, how is a bad job helpful? Is there some literature or something somewhere you could point me to to understand the correlation?"
2025-09-02,I think I want to go back to sleep now. Haha just kidding I’m buying on all the dips fuck ittttt
2025-09-02,Virtually every analyst raised their PT after the earnings call so that's clearly not it.
2025-09-02,$90 = load up on call options
2025-09-02,Buy low sell high?
2025-09-02,Sept sell off provides buy in opportunity
2025-09-04,"“they’re destroying the economy”.. Whole simultaneously seeing record levels of tariff revenue, ATHs getting hit on market tracking ETFs and continue to climb on, precious metals pushing ATHs too, bullish futures, etc…

I think they’re destroying your personal finances. The country is doing just fine."
2025-09-02,Bad jobs means fed must step in with rate cut bc they are suppose to balance inflation with unemployment. Make sure inflation isn’t too high and unemployment isn’t too high
2025-09-02,"It’s tied to the rate cut. High Inflation = keep rates high to combat, bad for market. High unemployment = lower rates, good for market. It’s the dilemma that the Fed is in right now and we don’t know what they will do. For the markets to go up we want a rate cut. So if jobs report this Friday is somewhat “not horrible”, they will likely not cut rates as they’ll need to keep fighting inflation. If the jobs report is bad, they’ll give us the rate cut Wall Street so desperately wants and markets will go up. 

I don’t have specific literature but you can google the above concepts."
2025-09-02,"I just buy and sell all the time. I'm holding now through all this,  this time,  but my average is one seventy four. It's not nvidia, that's hurting me. It's all the other ones arm, it really hurt me when it went through earnings. Never really caught up.Should have just held through the whole thing, but I didn't."
2025-09-02,But what about When the dip buy keeps on dipping ..🤣
2025-09-04,"Didnt trump just lose another court case involving tariffs?

My personal finances are just fine, I have 6k shares of NVDA and rental properties."
2025-09-02,"Yeah you’re swing trading and sounds like panic selling when there are dips. This isn’t some penny stock where you should panic the moment you see a 6-8% dip in a few weeks span.  

I’m not an expert so I won’t pretend to give you expert advice, but I’m guessing swing trading isn’t the best on long hole investments like this. You can’t be timing every high and low, that’s almost luck when it happens"
2025-09-04,"What’s the average cost on those NVDA shares? Unless you bought the dip back in April when it went from the $140 range to $80, or are simply an investor from just a few years back, any purchases within the last month-ish (more so end of July) would now be seeing a net loss, or zeroed out. 

Properties are cool and all, utilities are priced higher and real estate itself is not doing too hot in terms of new development. You likely are taking advantage of this latter point and raising your monthly rent premiums. The maintenance costs, however, have definitely seen an increase in cost unless you source cheap workers and buy cheaper replacements.

6k shares in NVDA though… I’d gtfo with profits if I were you. Fundamentally speaking, NVDA is only where it is at because of the resources invested in developing CUDA and getting it integrated into a lot of different programming libraries, especially those for data analysis. AMD has hardware that shits on NVDA in terms of better parallel processing - they also have the best CPUs available. Allow AMD some time and you will see NVDA lose its place as “tech royalty”. 

They also have a forward split coming up, if I am not mistaken. Once more retail traders come in, you best believe market makers are going to take the extra liquidity and sell off."
2025-09-04,"As for the tariffs, maybe? I haven’t been too caught up in the nitty gritty of the tariffs. I just know they have brought in over $100B in revenue since they were put into effect. 

He is seeking appeals for the over turning of them. They bring in too much revenue"
2025-09-02,"Then the opera singer voice: “Ooooooh!” 

Lmao, one of my favorite short series. I wish they’d made more"
2025-09-04,"I dont take unsolicited investing advice from strangers.

I have done very well with my NVDA and real estate tho, thanks for the concern"
2025-09-04,"Im not excited about tariff income...we are the ones who pay that. Ive seen massive increase in prices on appliances and building materials.

Giving the government more of our money doesnt feel like a win for the average american"
2025-09-05,"[Trump doesn't care that americans pay the tariffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoShitSherlock/s/rLPwQGNjG7)

Me not being a foreign country importing american products is irrelevant"
2025-09-02,"Clearly you haven't done your research when it's a fact that 50% of their revenue comes from 3 major companies. You haven't cited anything besides ""earnings"" that aren't impressive enough to keep this thing going.

Since u/easilygod blocked me like a true coward here is my response 

Nobody cited yahoo besides yourself. Everybody knows it's mostly Amazon, Microsoft and Google buying from Nvidia, I work in the data center industry and I've been sitting on my ass for months the hype is dying down people aren't ready to pull the trigger on investing in new construction just yet, I've been hearing about this boom for 2-3 years only to see projects stall or commercial real estate sales  fall through completely."
2025-09-05,"I’m not a Trump supporter, nor am I a supporter of our prior administration - so let my lack of understanding not come off as ‘blindly following his words’. 

I didn’t hear anything about “trump not caring that americans are paying the tariffs”. We are funding the war; we are paying increased interest rates due to JPow; we are seeing foreign countries pay the tariffs, or refusing to do so and having business with america be revoked. We are paying increased taxes (not necessarily able to be accredited to this administration), increased interest rates (due to the federal bank), increases to foreign products and likely a few other things I am missing. Where did he say that?"
2025-09-02,"You’re quoting a yahoo article bro Jesus Christ. Having a majority of revenue come from less sources is a good thing when you deal in innovation. P/e is great, company scaled massively and still beat earnings even with a major issue with China distribution which opens up a multitude of catalysts. You’re saying other people didn’t do their research when your only point is a yahoo article which isn’t even giving negative information lmao"
2025-09-02,"TSMC hiking prices isn’t just about squeezing — it’s demand signal. If fabs are raising, it means capacity’s stretched. NVDA’s margins might get clipped, but it also confirms AI chip demand isn’t cooling."
2025-09-02,Normally NVDA will follow with price hikes
2025-09-02,"Looks like same as you:

2025-09-02,They already hit $1000 once (and then they split the stock)
2025-09-01,"Hello

1) it's great that you invest so young.

2) your question shows that you lack knowledge in investing.

I would advise you to learn the basics first. You could go to a general investing subreddit (not a particular stock like NVDA) and learn. Check the wiki.

I know this is not what you want to hear. You don't need to have a Master degree in finance, but it's important that you know the fundamental.

But again, investing at 18 years old is already a great start."
2025-09-01,Just hold. Trust me. 200 will come. And dont panic sell when the dip comes. Maybe autumn till end of january.  It will go up again. I am owning since 20 dollars.
2025-09-01,"It's a highly volatile tech stock that just had an earnings report release on the 28th so yes completely normal. Don't buy stocks that you don't intend to hold for at least a year, preferably 5+yrs. 16 day return is meaningless, zoom out. 

Remember this as you're worried about hitting $200

""You’ve got to be prepared, when you buy a stock, to have it go down 50% — or more — and be comfortable with it, as long as you’re comfortable with the holding"" - Warren Buffet"
2025-09-01,First of all congrats... People usually start investing by the time they are in their mid 20's.. So this is a good head start. You are holding a stock which is creating the future for all... So I would say try to dig into fundamentals and keep holding.

2025-09-02,All walks of life are on Reddit here. Some definitely get uncomfortable losing money short term and others not so much. I've had -$20k day losses just with Nvidia over the years as I've been holding since 2014. You just can't cave to illogical thinking and short term trends falling victim to market psychology
2025-09-02,Whats your best investment? And your worst
2025-09-01,Good. We need to nerf india.
2025-09-02,"Yes they paid a subsidy for people in regions of India to use a communal toilet (almost none of the houses had a private toilet, at best they had an out house sometimes). When the government figured ""they probably prefer using these toilets now that they know how great it is to not smell poop everywhere we can probably just end this subsidy"" , the people freaked out and smashed all the communal toilets. 

The government installed new toilets, they were not used and then they were smashed again. I believe this happened one more time before the government just gave up."
2025-09-05,"Between earnings reports, this stock will go up and down based on all sorts of news (fake, perceived, political, or real).

2025-09-02,"Investors are bearish actually. If you look at CNN fear greed,  ycharts bull bear percent, and AAII sentiment, its above average bearishness. This tends to be a contrarian bullish signal. I understand the reasoning for being bearish now and I sometimes go short or long vix options. Right now I don't see a compelling reason to go bearish but there are certainly risks at the moment. I just always default bullish except when it is very obvious to me and yes I was short market for the April decline"

She's the MAG 7 anyone thinking that they're going to lose money on those stock long term it's hard for me to give advice because they didn't get the name MAGNIFICENT 7 randomly. It seems like these groups need to be named better so they target the right people because it's hard to tell if you're talking someone invested vs someone that trades
2025-09-01,Momentum. A few months ago it traded for half the price based on the same fundamentals as today
2025-09-01,LOL. It's between 3-10x fair value depending on what metrics you choose. Nobody could make an investment case based on anything more than hopiium.
2025-09-01,It is well documented fact that most investors don't make money on growth stocks. They buy far too late in the cycle and get burned when the price collapses.  
2025-09-01,What the fuck is a fair value of a stock ? Because every single stock is overvalued in the metrics dumb dumbs use
2025-09-02,"Often the best stocks of the last 10 years are not the best of the next . Sometimes they are the worst. But  most investors buy high and then capitulate when they lose a lot in dollars or percentage. In a killer bear market , many stocks and sectors are hammered. From strictly PE NVDA to me would be far more reasonable than a stock like TSLA which was declining earnings and a CEO that makes promises that he delivers years late and not as advertised. You can lose money in the best or worst stocks."
2025-09-01,Yup. I'm willing to free them from their money. I see dozens of new donors on Reddit every day

2025-09-02,This upcoming recession is gonna be the worst of them all and idk how much it’ll impact NVIDIA stock but my only advice is to take the profit when you see it. And mark the prices you enter and exit at on your chart every time you enter a trade. You can always get back in after you take profit

2025-09-01,98% overweight in NVDA isn’t much of a strategy beside bet on CUDA to hold the moat for continued DC growth and robotics.
2025-09-04,"Youre an idiot. When you buy this kind of option - no one expects it to actually go up to the strike price. When you buy this type of option - youre capitalizing on leverage built into the extrinsic value of the option premium at a very, very cheap price. 

But IDGAF you can keep gambling, or picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. Your money isnt mine."
2025-09-01,"You are legitimately retarded. What kind of fucking retard doesn’t have a strategy and an exit point. You traded emotionally and paid the price.

Technically still rising due to tectonic pressure, but to assume another moon is nuts. There are so many companies with upside potential, e.g. Reddit stock, Rheinmetall, Etc. look at how one overblown concern from deep seek dropped NVDA to 90s! I had sold at 150, peak. Expecting it, and rebought on the way up but diversified. One news, 150 to 98 $…. So 2026, depends on so many things, China geopolitics, etc. frankly most tech stocks are overpriced, NVIDIA less so but being at the top, unless global AI markets expand, NVIDIa risk losing market share. Then, thankfully quantum is not an issue as x1 quantum computer  could nullify billions in GPU value. Anyhow. Hey if I can pick Manulife for 30% growth, or SOFI, that seems smart right, 30%? NVDA and likes gave me 70% YTY returns until 2025, to expect more of that is just irrational. So, why or how can NVDA reach 4.5, 5 t trillion valuation? What if one of its top 4 customers switches providers? That is a 25% instant drop in order, yes, everything is presold. Yes, 50 years from now AI will be even crazier and important, but will NVDA be the same or the Intel of today?"

	•	32% per year for 10 years if you assume a 10% discount rate.
	•	48% per year for 10 years if you assume a 17% discount rate.

That’s the hurdle baked into the stock. The market is effectively saying:
	•	“NVDA must compound FCF at ~30–50% for a decade straight to justify today’s price.”"
2025-09-01,"250 sounds reasonable.

I'd guess yearly revenue increase would be around 60-70% . 250 is a reasonable ask.
On top Nvidia always innovate. Next big catch might be arm+nvidia replacing old style cloud all together.
And then mid range Adas cars.
Robotics is mid term investment.

Next frontiers - robotics and full autonomous vehicles…"
2025-09-02,$220 to $240. You can look at Leaps for a year out and see what people are putting their money on. Most people feel somewhere around $250 but there could be some bumps in the road before it gets there!
2025-09-02,"Ignorant clueless opinion here, but if you consider how realistic the odds of the AI/Tech bubble bursting within a year, then just reconsider if you want to temporarily invest the money/opportunity cost in etfs / dividends.

Here's some more food for thought...

1. Everything that goes up, must come down. Nobody can really predict the current market with the current administration and whole tariff situation, but I think we can reasonably agree that for the past couple of months, we have been hitting highs across the board and that's not very sustainable over a long period of time.

2. History or data graphs show that there are periods of time or cycles where money is shifted around. Right now, I guess the market has rallied often to keep it going, but the momentum is slowing down in my opinion and soon the wealthy smart investors will sell. It might be a few whales that start it, but the effect has a fair chance of snowballing till it's out of control. After all, it's the whales who have more control and influence when it comes to money vs the fish and dolphins in the working / middle class. If you were a whale, wouldn't you sell now to profit, then wait for the market to stabilize after all the dips to buy cheap stocks again? You after know which stocks or companies are reliable or have a strong future since AI and tech will still be important in the coming years after all regardless of what happens to the market.

3. Lastly, don't just tunnel vision into Nvidia. I would recommend paying attention to other related news that could affect Nvidia specifically Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies. If you want to run a thought experiment, then say Bitcoin enters a down cycle and cools down for a year before beginning to recover in late 2026. Do you think only cryptocurrencies will be affected or do you think tech stocks or Nvidia in this case will also be affected?

Tldr: I would do some further reflection and consideration before investing in Nvidia now for the next year. You can invest temporarily in other reliable avenues in the meantime like dividends or ETFs until the bubble has popped, the panic has passed, and the market has corrected and stabilized itself.

Or just Yolo and buy it now if your time outlook is super short and you just want to trade daily lol."
2025-09-04,probably going to retrace to 140 before anything major happens. I can’t predict the price after that
2025-08-31,$75
2025-08-31,$150
2025-08-31,"Bubbles can take longer to pop than people think, so if the AI bubble pops in one year much lower.  If the hype is still there I guess even higher.  Unless Mr. Huang finds another bubble to exploit."
2025-08-31,"Around 150, demand will slow down as the market gets saturated. Nvidia is priced for insane, unstoppable growth where absolutely nothing will go wrong and everything will go right."
2025-08-31,"Nvidia is just Cisco of 2000. Another bubble waiting to burst ! When this AI hype dies, it will be less than $50!"
2025-08-31,$275

2025-08-31,Every $40 in stock price is 1T in market cap.  Next up is $204 for 5T
2025-08-31,"True but they really do have amazing tech, a decent moat, and fantastic fundamentals. I do agree demand will slow down as investors wait to see tangible revenue from all the AI investing, which I honestly think is probably a solid 5 years, but the long term path is there. Nvidia will one day be a 10 trillion dollar company and I really don’t think that’s unrealistic."

2025-08-31,Sell puts at a price you would go in.
2025-08-31,I’ll wait till the employment report on Friday before I even think of buying
2025-08-31,"If you missed 173, the “dip” is over. Fearmongering post earnings will be past next week. Source: trust me bro"
2025-08-31,September is historically bad for NVDA so it wouldn’t surprise me if there is a slight flash crash but I welcome it as a buying opportunity.  I’m heavy NVDA but I don’t mind owning more.
2025-08-31,"Oh this is a super easy choice.  After doing an exhaustive amount of research on this exact issue I know the exact correct answer.

Buy or sell or don't do a thing based on your own research and trading profile instead of asking strangers on the internet. 

Good luck."
2025-08-31,"I think it's all about market sentiments. Currently the stock price is kind of volatile. But based on historical trends I see that there are a lot of growth opportunities for this tech giant. Especially, any positive news on China or tariffs will bring a positive momentum and the stock will receive most desired justice.

Happy Investing!"
2025-08-31,Buy some CRWV while you're at it!
2025-08-31,Buying dips has paid off for me but trying to time them and wait for them hasn't.
2025-08-31,"I think you need to wait to see what the large funds intent are with respect to the price movement, if they continue to suppress it and drive it backwards, there might be a better time to buy in the future. But if your goal is long-term meaning 5 to 10 years, I don’t think it’s gonna matter $10 this way or that way."
2025-08-31,My buy order is at $140.
2025-09-01,"Great question! I've been swing trading NVDA around these earnings cycles lately. Been keeping most of my trading cash in Tiger Cash Boost Account since it actually pays competitive yield while I wait for setups - definitely beats the basic cash rates at most traditional brokers. When volatility spikes like this post-earnings, having that extra return on idle cash really adds up, especially when you're moving in and out of positions frequently."
2025-08-31,I just buy weekly regardless of anything at all
2025-08-31,Wait for $50 a share
2025-08-31,"Definitely LONG term. I’m the proof .
I made a fortune from Apple,Palantir and NVDA ."
2025-08-31,Buying now is gathering dimes. Buying at $181 is gathering nickels. I’ll buy when it dips back to $145-$153
2025-08-31,the question is when to buy then lol
2025-08-31,Assuming you have the cash to buy 100 shares in one go.
2025-08-31,"Why? One employment report doesn't mean much, plus everyone knows job hiring is already fallen of a cliff as evidence of BLS coming out and revising the last 3 months of jobs to basically zero, hence why feds are already caving in and ready to cut"
2025-08-31,"Oh, you know unemployments gonna come in hot this go-round. Gotta be able to justify that rate drop! Buy the unemployment report and sell the rate drop. 😂"
2025-08-31,Your right.  Most likely September will be a bad month.  Also October.
2025-08-31,"It should be outright banned on this sub to make such 100% guaranteed claims. You cant predict the future, you dont know shit. Get rekt"

2025-08-31,But have you ever tried covered calls when the market fluctuates?
2025-08-31,would you ever buy more?
2025-09-01,"Duh.
We know. We don’t care. If you want to provide, you want to give to others at some point, you want to afford love lol.. gotta have the funds. Being a good person isn’t enough, a good man leaves an inheritance to his children (not just wisdom, but something tangible)"

2025-08-31,If you're asking for technical analysis advice on here you should just look up what that pattern means in a certain timeframe. It's often referred to as a double bottom but are you a trader or an investor? Anyone invested into NVDIA unless you hit a beautiful options play isn't gonna be a millionaire tomorrow just like the rest of the Mag 7! If you invest you're in it for the long haul throw your emotions out the door and if you're a trader than you shouldn't be asking that question. You need to ask yourself wtf is your goal and do you have a strategy? If so what is it and please always have some input or DD that comes from something better than #trustmebro
2025-08-31,Don’t be a chart monkey. Just hold the stock
2025-08-31,"W means buy more now. Weirdly, so does M."
2025-08-31,"Charting is bullshit. Case closed, the end. "
2025-09-03,W is bullish.  Though off the top of my head I think it has to hit 172ish to be an official w pattern.
2025-08-31,Trying to use TA when he's using the most obvious example of a double bottom and clearly doesn't understand what it even means or how timeframes work or anything and doesn't even know if he's invested or trading 🤦🏻‍♀️
2025-08-31,"Trust me my biggest mistake was selling nvdia and of course I bought back in but I'd be retired and without worry. You need to know how you can handle and are capable of handling the market and long term investments are always way less stressful because unless some shit hits the fan (which this CEO has been hit w more shit than any and blasts thru it every time!! AI is the market they are the KING!!! It went from a spit at $800 to a run to $1200 and split again and now we're here.

You've gotta have the stomach for her but invest in smart shit do your research and remember this is fine to get opinions from but dyor always"
2025-08-31,Thanks again.  Solid!  I did not know that background. BTW investing - but trying to harvest some gains along the way for some more immediate needs. Better-win-1559 - thanks much.
2025-08-30,I bought a cute 50 shares when I saw this drop $8 or so
2025-08-30,All you need to know is that it beat WITHOUT China $$$$. Beast.
2025-08-30,"Institution investors are on holiday and will be back after Labor Day. I expect they will be buying and driving prices back up, then rate cut on the 17th."
2025-08-30,My wife and I have accumulated 9700 shares over the past 3 years and we’re not selling. If the price dips we may buy more.
2025-08-30,"Yeah facts — folks calling this a “slowdown” are missing the forest. NVDA’s still running 70%+ top-line and >50% margins, which is unheard of at this scale. As long as hyperscalers keep throwing capex at AI racks, this name’s less a chip stock and more an infrastructure toll booth for the next decade."
2025-08-30,I wish I had money to buy this dip.
2025-08-30,"Guys it’s just the time of the year all the hedge funds are real allocating into September-October happens almost every single year profit taken year end tax selling individuals getting scared and dumping their profits before the holidays  137–1 47 yes, next year 225."

2025-08-30,"Not sure where you’re getting 70%+ as it was 56% YoY / 6% quarter over quarter.

Great numbers and Nvidia has a lot of growth, no one is saying it’s bad. People are just rightfully asking how much should you expect for a 4.5 trillion market cap and how much of this growth is priced in."
2025-08-30,"Can I ask what people think of the stock long term? I just got in, and I know say it's late but I do have a feeling that it is still a potential long term investment"
2025-08-31,10 to 1. Demand vs supply.  It's all good.
2025-08-31,What you are seeing is big money trying to get retail investors to sell.  Picking on a couple issues that aren’t really issues without covering all the positives is just market manipulation.
2025-08-31,"Nvidia’s current revenue run rate of approximately 30 to 40 billion dollars per quarter is extraordinary, yet the durability of that growth is far less certain than the market is pricing. Customer concentration remains a key risk. The majority of incremental revenue is being driven by hyperscalers, particularly Microsoft and Meta, whose accelerated AI infrastructure spend has been the primary engine of demand. This reliance on two counterparties creates a narrow growth channel and leaves Nvidia vulnerable to even modest deceleration in hyperscaler capital expenditures.

At roughly 100 times trailing earnings and 40 to 45 times forward earnings, Nvidia trades at a premium multiple not just to semiconductors broadly, where the SOX median is about 25 times forward, but also to other large cap technology growth names. The current valuation implies sustained revenue growth above 30 percent and continued expansion of data center margins. These assumptions are highly sensitive to ongoing AI investment cycles. If hyperscaler demand were to plateau or diversify toward alternative suppliers, the revenue trajectory could normalize quickly and valuation multiples could compress.

Although Nvidia’s technological leadership in AI accelerators remains unchallenged in the near term, the combination of concentrated demand and elevated valuation presents asymmetric downside risk if the AI spending curve flattens. Relative to peers such as AMD at about 40 times forward earnings and Broadcom at about 25 times forward earnings, the market is already discounting near perfect execution and leaving little margin for error."
2025-08-30,"I hope investors understand, this is a $220 stock without tariffs. I know cheerleaders love to wave their pom-poms for their orange 🍊 leader. As long as you enjoy losing money, keep it up."
2025-08-30,How's the stock price going down or even moving after hours? Why doesn't the stock market lock in closing bell share price?
2025-08-31,"Good, and i hope it goes below my cost avg so I could double down."
2025-08-31,"I had 70 invidia stock when it split, made a good profit, idiot me, sold all but 70 of them. Now after buying 20 more, I have 90 which the price almost doubled."
2025-08-31,Major banks have all raised target price around 215 so yes it’s still going strong
2025-08-31,Analysis on a business show I watched said it’s just ridiculous people worrying about Nvidia’s earnings. Said they are growing earnings 15% per quarter. He said that is a 60% growth per year. He has a price of $240 and said when Nvidia hits that he will raise it again.
2025-08-31,"It was an excellent quarter indeed, but it's downhill from here.. You'll never see that growth rate and margin again...

Of course you and other bulls will continue to overlook this fact, but that's the reality.. Not to mention growing competition and the possibility of a global recession.."
2025-08-30,This thread screams of new investors.
2025-08-30,"The most beautiful 50 shares in your portfolio, I presume? 😉"
2025-08-31,I have 1600 shares of pure gold
2025-08-30,That’s not really the point they are clearly a monster and doing amazing but their stock price is about exponential growth. They can still blow out earnings and be overvalued if they aren’t growing exponentially since that’s what is being priced. 
2025-08-31,This is why analysts raised the price.  target
2025-08-30,I don’t think it should be completely ignored that they missed the data growth rev estimate. It was a tiny miss but could signal some peak soon
2025-08-31,Not much of a dip when it at these levels what like ten days ago. I think institutions may try to run it down a bit more to shake retail out and then buy hard before rate cut. We won’t know when that is though.
2025-08-30,This is a stock to hold for your lifetime.
2025-08-31,I grabbed the 9/19s just to give me some room to breath haha I think people will eat up this dip this week as everyone knows it’s going over $200 we just don’t know when
2025-08-30,"Also huge investment banks, hedge funds and dark pools can move the market after hours."
2025-08-30,You think the markets gonna fall cause of people selling their little 50-100 shares ? Lol
2025-08-30,No went I bought at $88 😉
2025-08-31,"You dawg, my biggest regret of this year is not going that at $87"
2025-08-30,At least a 5% jump when that news pops up. People also forget about sovereign AI. Nvidia does not have enough chips for everyone… yet people freak out about a 3% drop lol
2025-08-31,But they always do. They undershoot and make the market know when things are an issue and when it is having problems. They don't beg for buyers they often downplay their capabilities
2025-08-31,The second earnings miss for data center revenue in a row.
2025-08-31,"I never said anything about the “market” - just $nvda. historically Sept is a horrible month for stocks, btw."
2025-08-31,Literally same. I only bought a few. Was just getting into investing then so didn’t know how good of a deal it was
2025-08-30,"Funny you say this, a random Arab guy who follows me on socials is selling a bunch of them for $35 each.

NOKIA BULLISH."
2025-08-31,Yeah that’s not the issue here it has nothing to do with them begging for buyers but rather their multiple. The price they trade at is based on extreme and rapid growth. Their stock could be cut in half even if they are raking in a ton of money because it’s about forward growth. It has nothing to do with them needing business they are clearly a juggernaut.
2025-08-31,"That really depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and conviction level. Conservative investors: 3–5% allocation (enough to participate in AI growth without taking big single-stock risk). Moderate investors: 5–10% (you’re bullish on AI but don’t want one stock to sink you). Aggressive / high-conviction investors: 10–20% (you’re okay riding big swings, essentially betting heavily on AI dominance) If NVDA is over 10% of your portfolio, you’re concentrated, expect big swings.
If it’s under 5%, you’re diversified but still participating. I suggest balance, you might pair NVDA with other AI ecosystem plays: data centers (MSFT, AMZN, GOOG), memory (MU), networking (AVGO), or even AI software leaders."
2025-08-31,Not for buyers
2025-09-02,Not sure how long you've been dealing with this stock but options are insane you NEVER KNOW WTF YOURE GONNA WAKE UP TO!! In 2 hours I watched my account fall out when they had the issue w China in 22 and Pelosi had us nuts because she cut her options at a loss a few weeks prior and guess what happened my shit went to the fucking moon after that. He finds problems to create solutions that's why he's taken this company to the level of growth he has in such a short amount of time.

2025-08-30,Good idea. Didn't think of that
2025-08-30,Nvida down more than the rest. Do not buy more yet. Without news we’ll see 150 shortly
2025-08-30,NVDA moves more than the market. We get news every single day. It’s your conviction that makes this stock worth investing in. It’s a good long term play.
2025-08-29,If this is considered a “crash” to you. You are heavily misguided.
2025-08-29,"There is never an “exact reason” because there is no possible way to know the collective thoughts of millions of traders.

The stock was priced for perfection, and forward guidance was far from perfection. Revenue growth is slowing and future capital spending of hyperscalers is in question, especially if the jobs numbers keep deteriorating. Hence, we have a fairly standard “sell the news” reaction.

The reasons are irrelevant, though, because only the price of the stock is what you can take to the bank. The failure to make new all-time highs likely means the stock will continue to consolidate through lower prices or sideways action as it continues to digest its massive gains in the past 4 months."
2025-08-29,"Lol, Nvidia is not crashing. General tech sell off after several days of gains."
2025-08-29,"Its the whole market, september is nt week, quarterly profit taking after a long run up. Should be back up after that."
2025-08-29,I wouldn’t consider a few dollars shaved off the price as a crash given the solid earnings and history of the stock selling off a little bit after announcement of results regardless of how good they might be.
2025-08-30,"Minor adjustment. This is a long way from a crash, so far. No fundamental reason for a crash, but an adjustment is not a bad thing."
2025-08-30,"The truth has been hidden in plain sight all along, Nvidia backwards is “ai divN” = ai divine, stocks only go up 📈"
2025-08-30,Brother it’s at $174 right now
2025-08-30,"“NVIDIA’s Q2 data center revenue—crucial for AI growth—came in at ~$41.1 billion, just under the ~$41.3 billion consensus, signaling potential early signs of a slowdown despite overall strong performance.”"
2025-08-30,I would think Nvidia stock is seen as a bit of a meme stock which creates pressure on stock value outside of normal stock metrics. It’s probably also suffering from major players entering and exiting the stock in extremely noticeable dollar amounts.
2025-08-30,Got a notification from Sofi app: Nvidia shares are trading lower following reports of DeepSeek shifting to Huawei Al chips and Alibaba unveiling a new Al chip.
2025-08-30,"Rotation from High^ US tech to the Last market that hasn’t moved in four years, which is China ; hedges are choosing Alibaba as profit-taking year end NYSE tax selling hedges reallocation for year end"
2025-08-29,NVDA still a safe bet? This is not a sell signal right?
2025-08-30,"I'm nee to stocks, if I understand correctly. NVDA grew crazily in the past few months.

People started selling to cash profits/expecting bad earnings/worse than expected = stock lowers

Stock being lower, people buy making it grow back up.

Thanks"
2025-09-11,"Still lol from ATH this is a pull back at best given the social stigmatic investor records lol. Crash is at least 20% in a short time frame in my book. 

I agree you’re right or just went long leveraged? N doesnt get options?"
2025-08-30,"Nope. -3.5% is not a sell signal, its a reasonable fluctuation"
2025-08-30,"There are no “safe” bets in the stock market.

As to NVDA, whether it’s s a sell if entirely based on one’s strategy and time frame. I hold an NVDA core position from much lower prices, so I have no plans to sell. However, if I had a new position entered recently above 170 I would be strongly considering using a stop loss and re-entering later.

If the market does enter a correction (typical for September-October) then I believe it is highly possible NVDA heads back to 150-155 area to re-test the prior all-time highs. This is fairly typical action for stocks that make all-time highs. If it were to get there and hold, I would consider it a strong buying opportunity."
2025-08-30,"NVDA long-term investors should realize and accept that a stock going sideways is a GOOD THING.

Sure, it would have been nice for the stock to gap open to $200 on earnings, but it’s simply not ready. Institutions have been dumping the stock since August 1 and there is resistance at $185. This could go on for months and it would still be very healthy.

Even if the market turns sour and NVDA goes back to $155 it would still be in a powerful longer-term uptrend.

So, when people call erasing 2 days worth of gains a “crash” after a stock has risen 100% since April and 70% since May, they just don’t understand the simple laws of supply and demand in the stock market, especially what it takes to move a stock worth almost 4 trillion."
2025-08-30,Its the end of a quarter profit taking after a long uptrend.
2025-08-30,"Of course, but even with it’s high evaluation could be some profit taking and hedges reallocate this time of the year"
2025-08-30,What you bought in at should have no bearing on your strategy other than for tax planning.
2025-08-30,"I disagree, on newly acquired positions. Stop losses are important. You may have the best idea in the stock market but unlucky timing.

Once you are in a good profit, you have the cushion to hold."
2025-08-30,You are letting that cushion convince you it's ok to hold and ignoring fundamentals.
2025-08-30,"I don’t ignore fundamentals at all. But I look at them through the lens of the market.

NVDA fundamentals back higher prices. But that doesn’t mean it’s going straight to $200."

2025-08-30,Lmao what? This isn’t a “crash” it’s people over reacting to alibaba news
2025-08-30,Just look at the chart for all time. This “drop” won’t be a perceivable blimp for the long term… if you want to play short term look at the meme stocks.
2025-08-30,"I captured my gains as well, didnt sell out completely.  I am thinking there is going to be a pullback to buy in again before ATHs."
2025-08-31,Don’t underestimate the 76 billion dollar buy back authorized. The dip may be short and shallow.
2025-08-30,Is there an fund that focuses on ai infrastructure like how do I invest in the people selling the shovels so to speak
2025-08-30,"I don’t own any puts. Unfortunately, this forum and I don’t know why it doesn’t let you show positions. I sold about 800 shares. You can look at my profile and probably see the post there. I had a few thousand shares from years ago just sold 800. I’m buying 800-1000 back under 147. That’s all. I still have my long-term shares as well"
2025-08-30,"I do. And my thesis is that LLMs as they are do not pass for AI in any sense. It is all fluff to boost shareholder value. True AI needs fundamentally different architecture, which we do not know of yet. Otherwise you are just dealing with a next-best-word prediction black-box."
2025-08-30,"Next-best-word prediction can result in generalizable forms of intelligence. I don’t think LLMs = AGI but they may very well be one component of it. 

If an LLM can autocomplete: “User has asked what the weather is. They are based in this location. I should call for [tool] that looks up the weather in that location, and then make recommendations on what to wear” 

This is autocomplete, instruction tuned LLMs already do things way more complex than this, and you can see how reasoning is encoded in human language here, which is the mechanism that allows for this kind of “intelligent” behavior. LLMs already “think” in sentences way more complex than this (talking itself through complex problems and invoking tools in the process to move itself through steps). 

To give you another very simple example, LLMs are bad at advanced math (without using tool calls) because next token prediction is not suited to mathematics. Despite this, by studying patterns in the training data LLMs “learned” how to do double and triple digit multiplication on their own. An LLM doesn’t know 1421 x 243 because it’s seen that exact equation before in the training data. It knows because it has “learned” how to multiply. This is what generalizable intelligence is. 

Interpretation research (trying to look inside the black box of a large language model) has shown when we increase the parameter count of a model, you see step function improvements in certain capabilities. One of such step function improvements in arithmetic is associated with the LLM “learning” how to encode digit order (essentially learning to “carry” a number over when multiplying). Does the model “understand” what this means like humans do? I don’t think so, but does it matter? It has learned a generalizable heuristic that helps it do X task. 

I hate when people on Reddit say “just next most likely token predictor” without really grasping how insane that mechanism can be when taken to the extremes. I’m not insulting you by the way - I think you’re in the middle zone of LLM literacy where you are right to be skeptical, but lack nuance. Most dumb people are either AI fanatics, or completely refuse the premise of generalizable intelligence. I think you’re a bit too close to the second group, and would encourage you to read some of the papers and see more nuance :) 

I don’t know how much better the current transformer architecture can get, but I work in tech and I can tell you that at least in the domain of software engineering, the leverage a senior dev gets with AI is fucking insane. These guys are shipping so much now, and don’t have to waste any time on boilerplate. Junior dev roles are completely cooked, and every senior developer is now more of a systems thinker and designer. It really is a paradigm shift, at least in this subset of industry."
2025-08-30,"In addition to the excellent response by u/sushirush I wanted to say I fall in his first camp. I am not a technical guy but I have understood these trends for a long time and built my career being early to them. Back in 2010 long before LLM’s hit the scene, having no idea of what the specific architecture would look like, I had a pretty good idea that AI would be doing about what it’s doing right now. I warned friends and colleagues to avoid certain careers that would be vulnerable to AI, which at the time most people ignored the warning, while these days the writing is on the wall.

The broad trend of digital intelligence is not slowing down, if LLM’s plateau another technology will take its place. It’s happened every time. We still have about 5 or less years til true human-parity AGI hits the scene based on this accelerating trend, so don’t get too comfortable thinking that the current limitations won’t be dramatically overcome in a few years."
2025-08-29,"There’s a theory named technological singularity.
It's the idea that a new technology, most often the creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI), will trigger an explosive, unstoppable cycle of technological growth. This ASI would be able to rapidly improve its own intelligence, leading to an exponential and runaway progression of technology.
This event is called a ""singularity"" because the technological changes would be so fast and profound that everything after that point would be fundamentally unpredictable and unknowable to us. So I think it can keep growing."
2025-09-01,AI is about data computation based on models. The amount of data created is increasing parabolically. The growing need of GPU will continue as long as the amount of data continues growing.
2025-08-29,"No one can predict. 
If you asked 20 years ago about best cell phone everybody told you about Nokia, but now you don’t see any Nokia phones.
AI is growing up fast and for training the Models we need GPU.
Currently NVIDIA GPU‘s are the best."
2025-08-29,"As long as there are world problems like diseases, economic woes, etc., we need crazy computational power to solve them which requires essentially 2 things: 

\-hardware (Nvdia HW for example) and   
\-Software (Ai)

Technology can continue to grow, but in terms of stocks, we don't know which companies are going to CONTINUE to have the best solutions. 

With Nvdia, their customers have a lot of problems to solve with Ai, so the company provides them with hardware. Here's the crazy part - those gpu's have to be replaced every 1-3 years. 

But of course, a few companies could show up and take some of Nvdia's market share. Look at Intel. It used to be the world's leading provider of cpu's but now the competitors are taking it's lunch money."
2025-08-29,I'm guessing by the time any company gets to their ceiling other revenue avenues will show up (hopefully) and they continue to grow.
2025-08-30,The potential is there and we’re not at any kind of upper limit yet with scaling up AI but I have a feeling if big companies investing into AI don’t start producing tangible results soon investors are going to get scared
2025-09-01,I just want it to hit $400 a share by 2030
2025-08-29,Some of NVDA's customers may run into severe cash flow issues if we get a substantial contraction of the economy. Competition will catch up with NVDA. Combined this will reduce margins at an increasing rate
2025-08-29,"Those Nokia phones were the toughest phones ever.  I dropped one multiple times from an areal lift at different times and even though it had some serious issues technically after picking up the pieces and putting it back together it could still be used for calls.  One fall from about 65’ straight to a concrete floor and once from about 50’ to a concrete floor and many times from over 30’.

2025-08-29,The company is still doing extremely well. It’s expected that growth won’t be as crazy as the last few quarters. Second derivative has reached an inflection point. This is good
2025-08-30,Growth declining but target price is set higher…okay?
2025-08-31,Yeah only growing 15% a quarter. How dare they grow earnings “only” 60% a year.
2025-08-29,Nvidia not only has strong performance. It also has entered Tesla territory of meme stock.
2025-08-29,NVDA is beating earnings because of stock buy backs.... Not because they are sustaining growth...
2025-08-29,"Which is why we will see declining stock price growth.

EPS growth is coming from stock buy backs..."
2025-08-30,"Target price on what timeframe?

Who's target?

How many Cathie Woods bag holders are out there because of her price targets?

I mean have your own thesis...but use analyst price targets as proof of anything..."
2025-08-31,At the current stock price.... Yes ... How dare ...
2025-09-02,I wished Nvidia would get Tesla valuation metrics. I would sell instantly and don't have to wait for years for that 4-5x on PE alone. With my position from 2016 another 4-5x would move the needle from retire early to retire pretty rich early.
2025-08-30,Not gonna lie I was a Cathie woods bag holder took me damn near forever to get out and still lost money smh
2025-08-29,"Exactly... Law of large #s... This is why large companies plateau.... Why would NVDA be any different?

They are production limited....and have a small customer base... 

If those customers reduce capital expenses...due to declining economic conditions.... Where are those chips going to go? 

China? Not looking favorable.... TSLA? Who has rapidly declining revenue....

Google.... Nope... They use their own design and framework....

AAPL? Nope they use Open AI which runs from Microsoft Azure....which is the only reason Microsoft is buying chips...
?"
2025-08-29,"Ok you seem like a lot. I mean by that logic you’re saying once everyone buys and iPhone and a macbook this year or any other in its past, Apple is finished. 

Technology constantly evolves, new levels of compute/interconnectivity are required to advance and move forward. You wont see google sitting on old clusters for 10 years like you are on your iPhone 5 perhaps. 

Explosive growth always slows because of law of large numbers but companies don’t just stop growing unless they fail to innovate like intel. Certainly don’t think Nvidia will see a slowing until back half of 2027/28… unless something significantly new is produced to drive the ecosystem forward."
2025-08-29,"That's not how Apple makes money.... They make money from that 30% fee they charge applications who use their platform....

AND because they have reduced their share count from 26 Billion to 15 Billion shares....via buy backs.... 

Hmmm... who just started doing that...."
2025-08-31,"Why do you think core weave might be a good opportunity? 

They are just a middle man, facing lots of competition from the larger cloud providers. Plus, it's very capex heavy, and they don't have any other business to fund their capex unlike Microsoft, Google, Amazon, who are cash cows. Because of this, I feel like it's very risky and would be very surprised if they can retain 10B+ valuation 2-3 years down the line.  

Please let me know if I'm missing anything structurally or otherwise"
2025-08-29,Who missed the boat? There is also something called a top... Did we all forget the $140 top that was only broken after Trump said NVDA could sell chips to China... Which didn't happen???
2025-09-01,"Well generally speaking. This gent is claiming a declining growth of Nvidia, his view is that because he’s seeing the tail end of explosive growth and a very well established company meeting the peak of global demand with the supply bottleneck. 

Coreweave is the opposite end of this with high risk and high reward, where since its IPO saw fairly parabolic rise until the acquisition and lockout ended. The reason I see it as a good (albeit risky) investment is because it’s serving the need of the explosive ai demand with advanced hardware. 

Their very heavy capex is success backed with large contracts. They are investing heavily in cutting edge tech and are increasing their capacity at a massive pace. In the case of the acquisition, if they tried to build this capacity it would take several years. They have taken a shortcut to provide greater capacity for the growing demand today. 

Debt and interest payments are a risk, losing big contracts or failing to acquire new ones is also a risk. But given their pricing model and cutting edge hardware, I think it would be a bold claim to say they won’t continue to grow. 

Ai is just in its infancy my friend. I’m happy to put $20,000 on this stock at $72 a share and see what happens."
2025-08-29,"Ok. We’ll see
I do swing trade Nvidia from time to time like peaks leading into ER. If you’re expecting the stock price to go down in the early years of AI and stay down. Cool. Good luck"
2025-08-30,"Lol and then the $120 top, $130 top, and $140 top before that. Oh and then the $150 top after that."
2025-08-29,"Good luck to you as well. 

Hope you hedge occasionally 😁"
2025-08-29,"I am sorry that's flat incorrect about the dot.con crash ....

Look at Sony, Cisco, etc ... 

These companies had extremely high evaluations during the dot.com era....

They are still here....but it has taken them DECADES to return to their dot.com prices ...

Look at those all-time charts and look at NVDA's chart.... let me know if you notice something..."
2025-08-29,"Sadly for this type of account, I do not. Just buy and sell, no shorts. Held through liberation day and very nearly sold before it, knowing it could be sketchy ground. Now that was a painful cost of hesitation"
2025-08-29,"Customer Concetration risk. If NVIDIA loses business with either one or both customers, or these two customers cut back on spending, then NVIDIA's revneues will take a big hit. It doesn't help that Customer A and B now have more leverage to negotiate lower prices as well."
2025-08-29,"Concern? None for 10-20 year hold.

But short term? What if those 2 companies decide they want AMD chips instead? Bam. 39% of revenue gone like that."
2025-08-29,Makes no sense.  If top companies are heavily investing in AI and show real case studies of how to monetize it every other company will follow suit and copy their blueprint.  If anything it’s insanely bullish that once implementation takes off more players will enter the market and revenues will sky rocket (assuming they will be able to produce more which they should with time and efficiencies in processing).  Also Nvidia has said repeatedly there’s not a demand issue at all that they are not sitting on inventory.  Even Blackwell chips are booked out for the next year.  This is just the market fishing for reasons to be bearish.
2025-08-29,"Nothing to be concerned about, those 2 buyers are only gunna buy more for next quarter lol"
2025-08-29,"Not many companies out there are building this level of scale or have the funds to do so. What do you expect, Target/TGiFridays to spend 5bn on a buildout and dive into Ai?"
2025-08-29,That’s why they try to sell to China.
2025-08-29,this can’t be new news ….
2025-08-29,"No one has mentioned this but if AI has a huge demand you should be seeing companies spending like crazy and a broadening out of the customer base.

Instead we are seeing the opposite. The reality is we a have a few companies willing to spend money for something that may actually not have demand.

This a common tech trap that happens people buy stuff that they think need not actually need. 

Let just say this microsoft  and Aws are the big customer and they overbuild. They will stop buying and then there will be a huge glut of chips they can not sell. If the demand is not there the margins will disappear"
2025-08-29,"If I told you that 40% of your revenue was going to slow by two major players so by the next 1 or more quarters you would lose a substantial amount of your profits from AI. Yes that’s where NVDA could take a hit and miss projections from wallstreet, because valuations are so high and follow forward earnings, this is not sustainable."
2025-08-29,"TLDR; they have big wealthy customers with deep pockets who are desperate to spend huge budget to win the AI race.

Bullish."
2025-08-29,Also to avoid receivables and achieve highest price why not satisfy hyperscalers first. All of these arguments punish pure success.
2025-08-29,"It’s just a hit piece, one of several lately designed to negatively impact the share price. Remember, the market is corrupt."
2025-08-29,This is really bad. That is way too high.
2025-08-29,Only two customers make up a high percentage of your revenue.  Those two drop or even one and revenue takes too big of a hit. Too risky.
2025-08-29,"How is that not a massive concern, the risk is significant if one of them dropped out of their earnings. Literally the ""too many eggs in one basket"" concern"
2025-08-29, Nvidia will sell every last chip for the next five years.
2025-08-30,Likely some company buying for China
2025-08-30,"Their press release highlighted that customer A and B are direct customers (vs indirect customers). That means they buy chips to incorporate into servers systems etc. so most likely these are contract manufacturers that could be Foxconn, quanta etc. most tech firms are not buying chips directly, they will direct it to a third party for integration."
2025-08-30,"Nvidia ""loans"" billions of dollars to Coreweave, who in turns ""buys"" billions of dollars worth of GPUs from Nvidia with those billions. Coreweave then builds out/leases out data centers to ""host"" GPU/AI data centers for Microsoft, OpenAI and others. Sketchy? House of cards?"
2025-08-31,Hasn’t this been a problem before? I’m pretty sure news articles publish good news after stock pumps and then negative news on stock dumps. Seems like market manipulation because all this information has been known and all the media before earnings were pretty much positive.
2025-08-31,There are multiple customers that would love to see a couple whale customers stop buying so they have a chance to buy them. Plus sovereign nations are wanting Nvidia’s chips.
2025-09-01,"If both are governments, we are good."
2025-09-02,"Reading these comments, it’s easy to spot who actually understands tech and who’s just throwing out bearish Reddit fingers hoping for a fall.

Nobody just “walks away” from Nvidia. The entire AI backbone of these trillion dollar hyperscalers is built on CUDA, GPUs, and Nvidia’s networking stack. Switching isn’t like flipping a light switch it would take years and billions. It’s the equivalent of Apple suddenly deciding to abandon iOS. Dumb move, not happening!!!!! 

Now let’s play out the bear fantasy

Let’s say one of the top two customers slows spending by 50% over a few quarters. Oh no, disaster? Nope. Demand already exceeds supply. Governments, enterprises, defense, startups you name it are lined up waiting for Nvidia capacity. Nvidia’s “problem” isn’t losing buyers, it’s not having enough GPUs to satisfy the world. Oh and by the way you don’t have to worry about that 

Look back at TSMC and Apple. Apple was its #1 partner. Apple diversified. Did TSMC collapse? No they scaled and became even stronger. Nvidia would follow that exact path.

And this idea that if two customers pulled back, Nvidia would “abandon the AI race”? Come on. The only scenario where AI slows down like that is World War 3. Until then, the race is only accelerating.

Listen to the earnings calls it’s clear. AI infrastructure build out is just beginning. Trillion dollar companies are competing like their futures depend on it (because they do). Apple and Google arguably under spent. Meanwhile, startups and billion dollar companies are scrambling to catch up to the Mag 7.

This is a race. And Nvidia is supplying the engines. If you believe in the AI revolution, the real strategy is making sure you’re diversified across the whole stack hardware, software, energy, infrastructure, robotics.
Oh but meta said they are cutting spending ?
Well I would hope so did you guys see what they just paid those engineers? More than LeBron lol 
That’s not cutting that’s.   “Hey slow Her down we just spent a shit load of money” !!! LOL
So yeah, “no more AI” because they hired more AI engineers? 🤦 lol they are playing the long game boys.   That’s bullish !"
2025-09-30,"Umm... Its not that much of a mystery...

# Nvidia's Sales And Customers

According to industry intelligence, **Microsoft purchased 485,000** of Nvidia’s data-center GPUs in 2024, and **Meta purchased 224,000** of the same chips. Data Center Processors for Analytics and AI account for Nvidia's largest source of revenue in 2024, totaling **$146.55 billion**, which accounted for **78.0%** of Nvidia's total revenue. Combined, **Microsoft and Meta accounted for 709,000 data-center GPUs purchased** last year. Those 709,000 units represent about **46 percent** of the roughly 1.53 million data-center GPUs bought by the six biggest cloud buyers. Market analysts have pointed to this high customer concentration as a significant risk factor for Nvidia. Any slowdown in spending or decision by these major clients to shift to competitors' or custom-made chips could negatively impact Nvidia's earnings."
2025-08-29,"Some may be circular invested neoclouds., who have collateralized their  GPUs. We all know which one will go bust sooner or later. This smells like a ponzi.
It will also drag down the smaller start up infrastructure providers in the ecosystem too."
2025-08-29,"It’s probably coreweave?

Nvidia is heavily invested in them.  They ‘sell’ to them to pump their own sale numbers up.  

It’s basically like selling stuff to yourself but getting the credit for sales."
2025-08-29,They are an arms dealer selling to both sides
2025-08-30,Nope. There is far more demand for Nvidias chips than they are capable of supplying the market. Any reduction in revenue by ANY of their customers will immediately get gobnled up by everyone else.  Cusomer concentration risk would be more like 80% of SMCIs revenue is a single cilustomer and thier MOAT isnt wide. Thats concentration risk. NVDA isnt NOT prone or at risk of this. How is this the top comment?
2025-08-29,MSFT has slashed DC investment as AI is not producing returns.
2025-09-03,Meta should have left only 20 bln $. Why shouldn' they not slow down buying soon?
2025-08-29,Makes sense nvidia isn't selling them more because there arent other customers
2025-09-02,"I wonder if those new guys at Meta get a red carpet? Maybe also some other geeks take selfies with them? LOL

Additionally, the 39% is completely out of context. What was the share 2 years ago? My feeling is that 2 years ago it was like 60% and shrinked to 39%. I remember it was said in 2023 that Hyperscalers are 80% of revenue and today it's like 60% . This is actually bullish because it means while Nvidia grows, it gets more other customers. Nvidia also tries to allocated around. If Hyperscalers could decide, they would be 100% of revenue."
2025-08-29,"Holy shit! In what world does 23% of total revenue not ""impact sales""? Are you fucking dense? Read the damn post before you respond! Jesus!"
2025-08-31,"its simple. large tech clients are generating an arms race. they all will build custom systems, not gpus. if nvidia makes something good next generation, they will stay around. if those companies believe they could generate a massive power savings and or create a huge moat in using their own specific packaging, they will not hesitate. i see nvidia announcing all these small products to become like apple to diversify their client base. i could see them dropping windows even. ecosystems are powerful for these giants. nvidia branded phone, arm cpu, and large clients."
2025-09-02,"Nvidia isn't selling them more because they are supply constraint. Have been for 3 years and continue to be. The 17% QoQ we see next quarter is from additional supply coming online, not from demand because that remains insane. CFO stated that fact in earnings call."
2025-08-29,"Other than Mag 7 companies, no one has anywhere near the free capital or use for 50-100B in Nvidia chips annually. Even the next 50-100 companies won’t be enough to replace 1 Meta unless you think JnJ, Walmart, Costco etc have a use for 50B$+ in AI chips."
2025-08-29,"Yep, I agree. Plus to my first response.. concentration risk is real in the short term. But AMD isn’t exactly a plug-and-play swap for Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem. Those 2 customers are likely locked into Nvidia for years because of the software moat, not just the hardware. Diversification will come naturally as AI demand spreads. Demand is so far beyond supply right now that if one or two big buyers ease up, there are plenty of others (UAE, Saudi, defense, hyperscalers, etc.) waiting to scoop up that capacity. The risk isn’t really “finding customers” it’s Nvidia being able to keep up with the production. Another reason I’m long with NVDA."
2025-08-29,Google also buys nvidia but still they may not be the top two
2025-08-31,That's like suggesting people won't be buying power from their electricity provider.
2025-09-03,"Heya pottymouth 👋🏽 

What is the value of your investment in NVDA? None, zed, zilch, zero…

Go away preteen troll."
2025-08-29,I'm bearish right now but..... What competitor?
2025-08-31,You ignore the signal losing 23% of revenue would send not just to the stock market but also to other customers
2025-08-29,It wouldn’t be as good but they could have AMD improved by a significant amount. I heard that apples OpenLLM was made on googles chips. I also heard that a few other companies were looking at making their own. Maybe Apple makes some improvements to their M chips and does cloud computing. All of this is at least 4 years down the road after NVDA doubles.
2025-08-29,"You’re talking shit, they can use AMD if they want to. Most of the hyperscalers are buying the MI355 and will be buying the MI400 racks. Stop being a wee NVDA fanboy and burying your head in the sand"
2025-09-01,Good argument. I stand no chance.
2025-09-03,Sigh. No one is “leaving” NVDA. Except maybe you? By all means - sell sell SELL the single 0.02 share fraction gammie gifted you.

2025-08-29,Betting against NVIDIA is like trying to pet a grizzly bear.
2025-08-30,"Indeed! 
Surprise it hasn’t been talked about more!!!

2025-08-29,"60 billion dollar buyback is Pennies  on the dollar. Even less than that. They buy back 60 billion and then five stock options to the big bosses in the amount of 150 billion. So you lose in the end. 
Nvda is a cash cow. They will be 200 by the end of the year."
2025-08-30,What are you saying?  You make no sense about the grizzly bear.  Don’t talk in riddles.  Nvidia is the picks and shovels of AI.  Understand?
2025-08-30,"Sorry, I didn’t read it right you like Nvidia.  That is good."
2025-08-29,"People see the percentage only and don’t realise buybacks affect the EPS also, which is something investors look into when deciding the good stocks. More buybacks = higher EPS = more attractive."
2025-08-29,This is true but when  a company gives executives stock options and they are exercised it negates the buyback. Buybacks are always good but they don’t always mean much. Like about it Nvda is worth 4.4 trillion dollars and the buyback was 60 billion. That is .06 trillion. Rather have a buyback then raising the dividend.

Even if NVIDIA reported better-than-expected earnings yesterday, the share price may not see a significant move unlike others. In the second quarter, the company also beat expectations, yet the market reaction remained muted. This has been a consistent pattern, with the stock typically reverting to its normal trading behavior. That said, NVDA remains a fundamentally strong and resilient ticker. NVDA is best for long-term investors."

2025-09-02,"It is not a crash, but it will go to $140. NVIDIA relies on company's investment not spending or OPex. Meaning that if those companies such as AI can't justify the ROI or they build their own chips like Google, then the PE should be adjusted"
2025-08-29,I upvoted you because what you said makes sense and some momma’s boy downvoted you… lol probably won’t last long though!  🤣
2025-08-28,"Yes, pre-market shows the stock price has not changed much from yesterday’s.  Where’s the crashing?  Let’s see if the price will end up green by market close today."
2025-08-28,"Massive overreaction if the dip was based on datacentre numbers in isolation. 

Perhaps the mania simply means that a double beat isn’t enough for some investors any more!

I’m definitely not selling!!!"
2025-08-28,"Thank you!!! I was just doing my regular job and this post freaked my ass. I should just hold it right? Crap, now I'm anxious"
2025-08-29,"I DID…!
I FAFO…!
Lost my ass on the call upside but I had started drinking and dreaming before I made the trade. I did get some PUTs but Theta stung bad with short expirations. 

All in all, I still bought inventory shares on the dip. LESSON: Next earnings run up, NO MORE TRADES except PUTs within range. Also, COVER the positions to get shares at a lower discount…

How ‘bout that TEMPLE University finance degree, right, huh guys, am I right…?!

😏🤑🤮"
2025-08-28,"There’s definitely some who got burned after that initial spike up at close turned immediately into a 7% reversal. 
Personally I just help what I had, happy that whatever happened would be short lived unless there was a horrific miss!"
2025-08-28,Ditto. Although I’m not sure we’ll see $120 I’d definitely be buying hard if it did!
2025-08-28,"Clearly not but you’d think so reading some of the reactions out there this morning!! 

5-10% corrections are a completely healthy part of investing and a great opportunity to build out positions or average down."
2025-08-28,"Maybe, but if you’ve seen the huge volume of ‘how am I doing’ posts for people who started investing two or three months ago and now expect 10% per month as that’s all they’ve seen I think it has to be a little bit of both."
2025-08-28,It’s already very close. Wonder how many panic sold at $175…
2025-08-29,I am 70 and holding for 20 years. Looking to buy a little more below 180. It will be above 200 before end of year. I will take 10% in 4 months.
2025-08-28,"It’s not those in their 60’s who are calling ‘crash’. 

If they’re in their 60’s and need the money in less than 10 years then hopefully they’re rotating out of single stocks into more stable assets. 

If they’re holding for the next 10 or 15 to build an inheritance to pass on then absolutely!!!"
2025-08-28,$150 would be ‘hard’
2025-08-28,Absolutely. I added at $176
2025-08-28,Only if you’re buying fractional.
2025-08-28,I’m very relaxed. Held everything I had and bought more at $176 when it dipped. I’m here for years. A dip is a sale!
2025-08-28,"Absolutely. 

It was a sarcastic statement regarding all the panic posts on socials about this being the end of the world when it only dropped back to Monday levels. 

Nobody ‘wants’ a 5-10% correction but they will always happen and I just hope I have cash in the wings to buy more!"
2025-08-29,"It was an idiotic post by someone who just wants to hear himself talk in hopes that he'd get likes and validation from the community. Instead, he has created confusion and has since backfired as he now has to run damage control by having to defend and explain said idiotic post which completely defeats the purpose of a post"
2025-08-29,Totally agree. The reaction was better this time than Q1 - I’m still holding!
2025-08-29,"Read the post again. 

It’s a sarcastic comment on those that called ‘crash’ and practically ran about in the streets in a panic when all we did was reset to the same price it was at two days earlier. 

Even 15% is only a correction. If there’s an actual crash, I’m buying every share I can get my hands on!"
2025-08-29,"I’m completely happy to admit I know very little about options. I have a basic understanding of covered calls but beyond that it would just be guessing / gambling. 

Part of me thinks I should stay in the dark as I’d probably want to play if I thought I knew enough to do it and the losses (with my level of ability) would no doubt be swift and severe!"
2025-08-30,Been following for a long time. There’s no panic on my part - just mocking those who threw a fit when the little tiny dip came…
2025-09-02,Agreed. I’m not selling!!!
2025-09-02,"This was a post mocking those that called crash rather than a statement of fact. 
I’m not sure we will see $140 again but if we do I’m still above my cost basis so I’ll keep holding that bag!"
2025-08-28,Not selling but actively adding negative content to the asset! GJ I guess 🤨🤷‍♂️🧐👍🙃
2025-08-28,"Don’t say “5 to 10”, ppl here would freak out and start downvoting you.. most of them want to see it green, all day, everyday."
2025-08-29,"Sale is on?
What sale?
I remained on the sideline, didn’t add or sell."
2025-08-29,"I'm not buying here,I'll wait for the crash, pullback but don't see it,"
2025-08-29,I've been trying to think about like what is the magic sauce that causes Nvidia stock to go up and I think it's the stock price going down that actually causes it to rebound so hard because it's like stock going on sale
2025-08-30,"100% lol 😆 I heavily bought in 2020 @ $8.35. I had $65k of gains from the 30,000% shiba boom so I decided to throw it all into this little gem. I'm locking in for the loooooooong term haha"
2025-08-28,"Shhhh - let’s just hope their iPad brains read the first two comments, got bored and moved on"
2025-08-29,"I'm sorry to tell you this, but you will likely re-enter at 200$. All this talk of a bubble is complete bs based on some philosophical thoughts and has no evidence in real data."
2025-08-29,"I have a fully built out position so I would normally have done nothing. 

However this dip was so ridiculous that I bought a small block of stock at $176 as a short term add so I could stick a finger up to the bears and shorts and buy a weeks groceries when it inevitably reversed - or just keep them in the unlikely event it didn’t. 

Turns out I’m having gourmet meals and eating out this week - for free!"
2025-08-29,"I had a 177 call and a 182,5 put I called them both in the morning made 230,I wasn't tying up 6000 until December,I believe it to bounce between 177 and 183 by end of year,if that wasn't a good report,there is not much more Jenson can do to make analysts happy,it will be one good report after another, I own the stock and will just be happy holding 3 to 5 more years out,my thoughts"
2025-08-29,"I won't re-enter, I prefer smaller stocks which brings me more money every day! 👍 I'm not an investor, I'm a trader!"
2025-08-29,"We’re probably going to see lower prices before we go higher from here.
I’m thinking around 150sh"
2025-08-29,"I have 2 open positions. Affirm is one of them, overnight trading, average price at $76 before earnings, 500 shares and my only long time hold is NWBO, 15K shares @ 0.26
Apart from this, I'm not holding overnight, I usually buy in the morning and sell when mu targets are hit. Nvidia won't jump that much in % to day-trade..."
2025-08-30,"Look at Nvidia now, I'm happy I sold at $180 :)"
2025-08-30,It will rebound soon. It can be a good idea to entry on days like these. I'm going heavy on alphabet right now:)
2025-08-28,"Seen this chart 2 times in 20 mins and it’s wrong it’s missing “other revenues” of $0.15B. 

The sum of listed segments is $46.59B but apparently no one cares and posts whatever"
2025-08-28,Time and consistent profits will make it move. Just keep buying and holding for the next 15 years
2025-08-29,NVDA just announced a $60 billion buyback.
2025-08-28,It was a pretty good quarter..probably turned positive as Trump was on Fox talking about possibly allowing Blackwell sales to China
2025-08-28,"Having both ASML and Nvidia this is reminiscent to the past couple years of ASML where the Dutch were fooled into slowly giving up the China market. It probably won’t be as bad for Nvidia if AI in the west keeps up the momentum.

Similarly though, I’m afraid the damage will be done and in the future growth will have to come from elsewhere."
2025-08-28,"The question is what is priced in right now? 
Exclusion of china revenue or hopes of future china revenue inclusion. Anyways, as he said, the AI race has begun and I find him a trustworthy CEO"
2025-08-28,"Wait a minute, as I recalled the stock jumped on sale of h20 news from 156-180ish now h20 has no sale and we expect stock to pass 180?"
2025-08-29,If in Q4 we have licensed sales of a version of Blackwell instead of H20 then my fair read of his comments would be that revenues quarterly could quickly get to $60-65 Billion if China adds 7.5 to 12.5 Billion a quarter.  If so (and I believe) the impact on the stock will be 10+ percent - in other words very material.  Analysts will spit these out immediately they are already written no doubt.
2025-08-30,Earnings beats and new product launches move it harder than any China headline ever will.
2025-09-02,"NVDA has momentum and valuation, a rare combination in the past but not as much in this bull market. As long as the market doesn’t collapse NVDA will continue its path into triple duces."
2025-08-28,"US - no chips for China 

China - don't want them 

US/Jensen - please buy our chips 


A meme stock now moving forward."
2025-08-30,Sell
2025-08-29,That was old news… Aug 11th
2025-08-30,Good luck with the AI bubble.
2025-09-02,The AI factory is about robotic AI.  This is it!
2025-08-29,Well he did lift H20 but also at that same time leaked the news of allowing scaled down version of Blackwell sales to CN….  Did he talk about full on Blackwell proper sales ystdy?  That would def impact
2025-08-29,Bullish
2025-08-28,"No, it's unthinkable that one single company stays on top of an entire industry of this value for 30 years."
2025-08-28,"Interpretation

Margins & Profitability: Extremely high (gross margin >70%, net margin >55%) – reflects dominance in AI chips.

Liquidity: Strong cash position, current ratio 4.2x → no short-term financing risk.

Leverage: Minimal debt, balance sheet very healthy.

Efficiency: Asset turnover 1.3x shows effective use of assets; inventory turnover improving but slightly stretched as inventories ramp with Blackwell.

ROE >100% highlights massive profitability and buybacks reducing equity base."
2025-08-28,"No. Some of their customers will not exist in 10 years and most of their other customers will struggle a lot in the ""AI boom crash"". It looks increasingly possible that we hit stagflation and if we do, they may be a $3T company in 10 years"
2025-08-28,I don't doubt that possibility.  I just hope a Whopper and Big Mac don't cost $50 at the time :)
2025-08-28,Hold. I'm at @181.5 so it'll take a while to recover & make profit but no way I'm taking the loss on Nvidia.
2025-08-28,My cost basis is $5 so obviously holding.
2025-08-28,"Waiting for a dip, 170ish to buy more."
2025-08-28,I bought more shares at 176 bringing my average to 131
2025-08-28,"I'll buy more whenever I get the chance, current average of 173. Jensen's interview with Yahoo finance really instilled confidence in me."
2025-08-28,"Yeah, same. I only started investing a couple months ago, bought some NVIDIA at 180. No point letting go if it's only gonna go a few percent either side of that. See what happens with it in a few months time."
2025-08-28,How many shares?
2025-08-28,"Calm down.. this is AH and just T+1.. it may go up or down, not predicting anything.. but don’t get overexcited by AH algo actions"
2025-08-30,Bears appear to be doing fine job.
2025-08-28,Posts like these make me want to sell
2025-08-29,"Invest, yes. Over time, you will be rewarded. Local ATH can be ignored for long term growth.

Trade, maybe, but you aren't going to kill it. Short term gains maybe limited.

Do want supports your reason to put $ into the market."
2025-08-29,Funny that a few months ago it was less than $90 and has since doubled.
2025-08-28,"Where were you a couple months ago when it was $94?

Currently, I have a good till cancel limit order in for $140."
2025-08-28,"Not investment advice ; Everyone is making fun of me but i say sell your nvidia so i can buy. This is a bullish statement. 
Whatever price you buy at is about your conviction and horizon. If you have 5 years, 175 is a great place to enter. 

Investing is, risk management, it went up to 183 went down to 160s recently, you buy a bit at 175 now, and wait, if it goes up and news are out overwhelmingly positive like nvidia selling to china finally, buy higher and dca. If a deepseek like fud happens, you buy while everyone is selling, when it goes to ath you sell” a portion” to reduce your risk and move on. 

If it goes lower on negative news but fundamentals didnt change, you buy slowly the dip. This earnings was not that, business is booming just the regulation is hurting nvidia rn. 

You only sell if nvidias core business is hurting or future guidance is shaky, Prices are irrelevant."
2025-08-29,He didn’t know what NVDA was until he saw it all over the news and his sm feed
2025-08-28,"NVDA flexing a $60B buyback is pure alpha, but that margin slip tells you they’re moving from easy GPU money to heavy capex data center builds. When 40% of rev is tied to just two clients, that’s concentration risk all day — one hiccup and EPS could get smoked short-term."
2025-08-28,"Buyback is less than 2% of market cap.

Nothing life-changing."
2025-08-29,"I think any chip they manage to produce will be sold, even if these two customers pull out. Demand is not yet saturated and these are likely deals struck many quarters in advance, if not years. I’m not concerned about long-term impact of concentration risk."
2025-08-28,"It’s the implication that matters. They believe the company has a long way to go still, plus 60B in buybacks is not a small number by any means."
2025-08-28,"NVDA started the year at $138ish.  Almost 30% up.

Did you buy at $185 two weeks ago and you mad you haven't doubled your money yet?"
2025-08-28,Yes. Sell low now so I can buy low.
2025-08-28,"Q1 earnings.  Stock goes down $4. Then spends the next 3 months gaining $50. 


Q2 earnings. Stock goes down $4. Then..."
2025-08-28,Can't wait to buy more tomorrow morning
2025-08-28,It's time to buy the dip 🚀
2025-08-28,So 50$ up from now?
2025-08-28,"Those are for nvda FY2027 full year estimate. We are still at q2 FY 2026 released today. Would be 1.5 years trading earnings. It’s probably around a 35 forward one year pe atm based on some estimates, could be as high as 40 though. A lot of unknowns regarding capex from hyper scalers, seeing how they may or may not increase capex more or not. They are stretching their capex though."
2025-08-28,"The other 3 tickers you’ve mentioned have relevance to the average consumer, which NVDA does not. I’m not saying you’re wrong, but when only a minuscule percentage of people will directly use your product, the stock price will suffer"
2025-08-28,"50% earnings growth does not imply 50% stock price growth. PE ratio will come down as the market forecasts slower growth ahead.

If market sees growth slowing to 20% in 2028, do you really think nvidia will maintain a 40 PER in 2027?"
2025-08-28,"It was good, which is okay for a 4.5t company. Okay means it's bad for wallstreet."
2025-08-28,"$54B +/- 2% Assuming no China Sales. Could see $2-$5B more if restrictions ease by October. ""AI race is on and NVDA is at the center"" -Jensen"
2025-08-28,"## NVIDIA Q2 FY2026 Earnings - Quick Analysis (NO SELL SIGNAL)

### Key Metrics:

**Q3 Guidance:** $54.0B vs $52.7B consensus (+2.5%) - SOLID  
**Q2 Revenue:** $46.7B vs $45.9B consensus (+1.7%) - BEAT  
**Data Center:** $41.1B vs $40.2B consensus (+2.2%) - BEAT  
**Gross Margins:** 72.3% (ex-H20) → 73.5% guided Q3 - IMPROVING

### Blackwell Update:

- Growing 17% sequentially, including Blackwell Ultra
- Revenue recognized across ALL customer categories
- NVLink networking up 46% sequentially (GB200/GB300 momentum)
- CSPs represent 50% of Data Center revenue

### Why This Isn’t a Sell:

1. Guidance beat consensus by $1.3B
1. Margins improving toward mid-70% target
1. Blackwell ramp accelerating as expected
1. China H20 impact already absorbed ($4B reduction factored in)
1. $60B additional buyback authorized

### Score: 72/100 - SOLID RESULTS

**Expected reaction:** +3-5% recovery tomorrow. The earnings drop appears to be options hedging/profit-taking rather than fundamental weakness.

**Recommendation:** HOLD if you’re in.  If you want in think long term.  These aren’t blow-out numbers but they’re solid execution in a transitional quarter. No red flags that justify selling."
2025-08-28,It’s all priced in
2025-08-28,Everything is good but the government is about to blackmail us for billions
2025-08-28,23% of the revenue was from a single guy purchase.
2025-08-28,Exactly why I own shares and don't play with options.
2025-08-28,"Invest in this shit , I’m an electrician, we’re building data centers, and they want like 30 more by 2030, buy this fucking stock"
2025-08-29,Have you guys ever heard of just buying stock and then just forget it about it for a while?
2025-08-28,I’ve been shaving 100 blocks at $175+ the last few weeks. I also 5000 shares so I want to not have half my money in one stock
2025-08-30,$800 by 2030
2025-08-29,I own shares and trade options and make profit 😜
2025-09-02,"Yep I got an average price of 15 bucks a share, I got it way before it split and don’t plan on giving up or selling my shares for a long time"
2025-08-29,Open a short Iron condor expiring that week or the week after. Target 85 - 90 % profitability. You can easily make 5 - 20% a week on earnings. Your selling options to wsb peeps.
2025-09-01,"Strike options aren’t a specific type, at least not that I’m aware of unless you mean something else.

The strike price is just the specific price of the stock you think the stock will go to.

Let’s say Nvidia is at $170/share and you think it will go up to $180/share by the time your options contract expires. $180/share is the strike price. This option is called a CALL.

Let’s say Nvidia is at $170/share and you think it will go up to $160/share by the time your options contract expires. $160/share is the strike price. This option is called a PUT.

Options are basically just bets where you think a specific outcome will happen (call = “I think the stock will go up to this strike price. put = “I think the stock will go down to this strike price”)"
2025-08-28,Bro just buy and go live your life lmao
2025-08-28,Because a good earnings call was already priced in.  It had to be an insane beat to really go up
2025-08-28,It was priced to perfection. Any miss at all will cause a drop. It’s a 4.5T company what did you expect?
2025-08-28,"Honestly, you should buy tomorrow,  this is a dip and it'll probably be hitting $190 by thr end of next week"
2025-08-28,Simple: It was priced for perfection. Would have needed to beat estimates even more. Same as in previous earning calls. No surprise. Plus: It’s simply massively overvalued at this point.
2025-08-28,"Big hedge funds add puts and such during earnings. 

Its pretty common a stock fails after great earnings before a pump."
2025-08-28,This makes the last 3 or 4 earnings calls when the stock went down after posting good earnings.
2025-08-28,"4-5% is nothing. From 184 even close to a 10% drop is nothing. It’s a short term correction. It will get above 200 in the next few months anyway, the whole ai spending is pretty much majorly nvda. If it hits 160$ short term it would be a dream to buy more!"
2025-08-28,Priced in
2025-08-28,Why does it go up with no news ?!
2025-08-28,"In the past month the stock has ripped right at 30%.  For a massive company this is extremely rare.  The minute pullback is hardly surprising.  The continued debate and FUD over AI bubble busting fuels the ability for hedge funds to short the stock.  Any decent dip offers opportunities as it goes down then fuel to cash out on the way back up.  Large funds play both up and down.  By creating various minds of doubt allows you to chip at the news feeds with paid agenda and clips that can start to have bigger effects and create more motions.  These are all real but so is the fact that in 3 months we are most likely looking at an additional 20-30% gain which is far and above the DJ S&P insert any ETF here and most likely the fund has its gain mostly from NVDA and AI pulling the load. 

It’s a single moment and it will soon be overshadowed by far more profits.  They are buying back a massive chunk of shares as well so this is also good news to add to the earnings which were in fact factored in. Had the missed by the slightest margin it would have been a massive dip as panic is being pumped out on an ever growing frequency.  

Be patient good luck friends"
2025-08-28,"Stock price drops and large institutional investors step in! However, don’t blame the institutional investors, blame those individuals who sold when they should have been staying put or buying more shares!!!!"
2025-08-28,"If you can’t handle a few percentage drop, you shouldn’t be investing.."
2025-08-31,NVIDIA is a long term play... I won't even see short term movement
2025-08-28,Didn’t we all warn about this over the past few days?  Beating isn’t good enough.  Needed to be a huge beat (more than $500M) and a guidance raiee to move the stock.  Expectations are ridiculous.  If you believe in the company use the dip to buy more and be happy.
2025-08-28,NVDA may have a bad evening.....
2025-08-28,Nvda typically goes down after earnings. But only for a few days. Then it's your typical buy the dip scenario
2025-08-28,"Because of copium 
AI stocks are out of fashion
Nvidia may be selling to companies who believe AI is the future but the end users find it really dumb."
2025-08-28,So basically good but not good enough
2025-08-28,"Yea, it had already run up like 15% since Q1 earnings"
2025-08-28,How are the earnings already baked in when the financials are not available to the public until the earnings call?
2025-08-28,$8T like Dutch East India Company.
2025-08-28,Focus on the long play not the blips.
2025-08-28,A 4% drop is nothing in the grand scheme of things. I'd recommend studying the post-earning market reactions for the past few quarters-- this was expected.
2025-08-28,"Wait til folks have had a chance to actually listen to the earnings call. The forward guidance doesn’t assume any sales to China, while they are preparing an advanced chip to ship to China. They are working with the administration on getting a license for that chip, not even the H20, far inferior. Commerce Sec Licknut, or Nutlick, insulted China and screwed up the whole H20 deal where Trump would get 15% for the US Treasury. The main concern is national security, but we are so far ahead in every avenue, there is no reason to hold off shipments of advanced chips to China that are a few levels behind, but way more powerful and efficient than Wah Wei’s (sp) chips.

The demand for the increasingly more powerful and efficient systems will likely be going on for a decade. The future is here. If you have children in school, make sure they are into STEM, or even robotics electronic technicians and mechanics, programmers, etc. The future factory floor will look nothing like what the boomers have had to work in. The lowest jobs will be the robotic overseers observing that their area is functioning as it should, by visual and many computer screens akin to traffic control. The mechanics and electronic techs will do preventative maintenance and emergency repairs to keep lines running. I’m sure a Tesla factory is closer to that regarding automation than what the old assembly lines looked like.

It’s going to be a long time in the future when when NVDA’s growth rate slows to a halt, where the chips are commodities and the margins are crap. There will be plenty of advanced warning. Don’t ever listen to short seller bs. Make sure you rely on reputable sources!"
2025-08-28,I am well aware of NVDA earnings cycles. Im just saying if the beats were priced in then it should stay the same.  Earnings beat Wall streets numbers but not the masses! It will bounce to 185 by 9/15
2025-08-28,I hope it's 15. Then I'll buy in
2025-08-28,Higher expectations than that were priced in.
2025-08-28,“Prices to perfection” here is continuing to beat expectations by large margins. Mr market seems to be punishing any ER that doesn’t “knock (the proverbial) socks off.”
2025-08-28,"Apparently, most people are smart and sell so they can buy back in at a lower price. Fluctuations are normal."
2025-08-28,I have been saying this the entire time. Look this AM if it was priced in it shouldn't have went down.  now this AM its over 180 again and it's premarket. could go to 183 today.
2025-08-28,"The thesis that Nvidia’s Q2 earnings “disappointed” investors is a classic case of moving the goalposts. Let’s be clear: $46.7 billion in quarterly revenue, up 56% year-over-year, with $41.1 billion from data centers alone, is not evidence of a maturing or weakening business — it’s a generational growth story unfolding in real time.
The article downplays the fact that Blackwell data center revenue grew 17% sequentially — an annualized run rate of more than 80%. That’s not a slowdown; that’s the strongest product cycle ramp in semiconductor history.
Nvidia isn’t just selling chips; it’s building the compute backbone of AI infrastructure globally. The company is embedding itself at the core of sovereign AI initiatives in Europe, industrial AI clouds, autonomous driving platforms, and drug discovery partnerships. No competitor comes close to that ecosystem dominance.
Yes, growth rates have normalized from the once-in-a-lifetime 200%+ surges during the initial AI boom. But calling 56% growth on a $46B base a “slowdown” is intellectually dishonest. At these revenue levels, Nvidia is compounding faster than virtually any mega-cap in history. Operating income jumped 53% year-over-year. Net income rose 59%. EPS surged 61%.
Margins — despite temporary headwinds — remain in the mid-70s, guided higher next quarter. These are industry-leading profitability metrics that most companies would kill for.
Valuation complaints also miss the bigger picture. Nvidia isn’t a chipmaker trading on cyclical P/E multiples. It’s a platform company sitting at the nexus of the most transformative tech shift since the internet. AI infrastructure demand is compounding, not plateauing. With $60B more authorized for buybacks, $56B in cash, and free cash flow north of $13B this quarter alone, Nvidia has both the growth and the balance sheet to support its valuation.
Calling this a “Hold” because the beats weren’t large enough compared to last year’s hypergrowth is like criticizing Usain Bolt for running a 9.7 instead of a 9.6. The numbers remain breathtaking. The real risk isn’t that Nvidia has “slowed” — it’s that the market underestimates how long this AI investment cycle will run, and how central Nvidia is to it.
Moral of the story?
This isn’t a maturing business — it’s the most critical technology company of this era, compounding at unprecedented scale. “Waiting for a better entry point” has been the losing strategy on Nvidia for the past decade. Betting against it now is just more of the same."
2025-08-28,"WSJ says it's ""because of the narrow miss of revenue forecasts for its data-center business.  It was the second consecutive quarterly miss for the segment""."
2025-08-28,"They are not priced for bad numbers. They are not able to sell their product. Much of their numbers are backlog. When that is resolved the profits will be huge. The problem I think is that many of their suppliers have no desire to scale up for one customer. This demand will die over the years. The manufacturers remember the boom and bust of smart phones, PC boom and bust, and the crypto mining bust. Their margins are thin. Look at the hype with Foxcomms New Mexico plant. Long ago, still not one shovel of dirt has moved. Manufactures margins are thin. They will expand capabilities at exiting plants via robots. But slow to have any desire to build billion dollar factories and wait for the bust. And they are not behind focusing on one buyer, NVDA. So as I have said for sometime, until the headwinds go away your going to see more paper with orders on it then boxes of GPUs shipping. Just my take. I am a fan and buy LEAPS, and the stock at its low points. Anyone could have made a safe bet that the stock would drop today. It was a dismal earning report for a stock priced to perfection. That is the way the market is."
2025-08-28,"Very good result, but I'm not sure it justifies a $4.5 trillion valuation and a P/E of 60."
2025-08-29,So we good on hitting $400 still by 2030 lol
2025-08-28,In summary - a double beat isn’t always a ‘good enough’ double beat.
2025-09-01,"Just a quick question, I’ve only been or even had any interest in the stock market for less than a year. So is it normal for a company to have zero insider buys only sells for over 2 years? Not any buys except for automatic buys that were sold?"
2025-08-28,This is the sanest post I've read on this sub in a long time. Thanks. Felt like I was losing my mind.
2025-09-01,"The CEO cfo etc sales I believe your talking about have to be reported to sec to prevent exactly what you stated insider trading issues. 

Plenty inside buying and sales by those not in a position that has to be reported. Most of those in the high positions don’t need to buy as it’s part of their compensation package at the lowest price at the quarter as well."
2025-08-28,"WTF, you're late! Everything priced in already haha"
2025-08-28,"Nvidia guidance = $0 from Chinese chips

Stock will go up on any news about Chinese sales

Use this as a buying opportunity after a few days/weeks especially if Nvidia starts selling Blackwell B30s which are way better than Hopper H20s"
2025-08-28,Relax guys. It’s only down 2%. It’s gonna make new all time high before the next earning in 90 days. This has been the trend last 3 earning reports.
2025-08-28,Its priced in report. Everyone knows demand is high nvda is going to beat. This isnt speculative earnings . It will consolidate and move higher
2025-08-28,"The big issue was their profit margin dropped, that's the reason their stock droped, everyone was expecting them to beat earning ( they did) with an equal or better profit margin, margins are not up (quite the opposite actually)."
2025-08-28,You re right ıam not going to sell it Nvidia is best
2025-08-27,My guess is down 4% on amazing news
2025-08-28,"Probably smart, i'm guessing 10% on nothing but good news, then ATH in 2 weeks. I wont sell because I like having a nice low avg and i'm not that smart."
2025-08-27,Tell me why it would be different than any of the few other previous earnings ?
2025-08-28,"The options market is currently pricing in a 6.52% move up or down tomorrow, meaning a trading range of 170.13 - 193.87 ... but who knows what will really happen until the earnings conference call and we hear the forward guidance."

Something is happening just don’t know at this moment!
Kinda exciting though!"
2025-08-28,Buy high
2025-08-28,"I think it will be volatile one way or the other. AI bubble fear is already priced in. The earnings could further increase that fear and we drill down or completely discredit it, in which case we moon. I don’t see a scenario where we don’t move at least 5% in one direction."
2025-08-28,"I bought a bit more than I wanted to hold long term during the last recent dip, so I sold that today. If it does dip again I wont be able to resist buying it back again because why not"

2025-08-29,"Don’t worry, this time in October, you will ask the same question while sitting on shares valued at $203…"
2025-08-28,If he is so confident he should leverage up on shorts and make big money.
2025-08-28,It does with NVDA! Now I’m buying back in the morning.
2025-08-28,Same... I'm in good and unless it drops below 120 I'm in for the Long haul. I'm afraid to even add to my position cuz I don't want my average to go up LOL
2025-08-27,"“Few” means three, that you are inquiring about, so three quarters ago it dropped 5.6%, along with the previous four before that, only the past two quarters has it risen at earnings report."
2025-08-28,"I’m buying back in the morning, about 2 hours after open."
2025-08-28,"good, no wet powder"
2025-08-28,Amazing! I have lots of white powder. $500.
2025-08-28,Sell low?
2025-08-27,"30k in calls, 30k in puts, 5k in shares"

2025-08-31,Why not wait for the inevitable correction in the stock. Nvda will likely visit $140 within the next two months. Thats a discount of almost $40 per share.
2025-08-27,His house was worth $65k? (I’m joking)
2025-09-02,I think rn I have 259 at a average of 138 I have another 20k between intel amd kura sushi alliant energy red cat affirm ups tilray
2025-08-27,"I think he meant it's a bad time to buy NVDA, right before the earnings report."
2025-08-31,Everyone keeps calling the top. Ignore them. That 65k will be fine long term. Some of these posters have very short term memory.
2025-08-27,"Oh right, I get that I’m for sure gambling on it being good but speculation assures china will not let that happen but let’s hope!"
2025-08-27,Buy high sell low
2025-08-27,"It’s not gambling if you hold it , bc nvda will be worth more anyway after today regardless"
2025-08-27,"I hope people like you got excited when stuff goes down , nvidia is ath and earning report today. Buy great companies when the market doesnt appreciate them. Not saying nvidia wont go much higher but this is not buyers market. More like hold and trim"
2025-08-27,I’m holding for at least 10 years and putting 18k a year into the rest of my portfolio watch kura sushi closely!
2025-08-27,The satire will backfire after NVDA’s earnings report to be released after market close today.
2025-08-28,Pre-market stock price only drops 1 percent as of now.  Earnings report beats  both EPS and revenue.  It’s an opportunity to increase shares of NVDA.  Long-term investors have been rewarded so far and will continue to do so.
2025-08-28,Who has the laugh?  The stock price is slightly up at the open.
2025-08-30,"Don’t worry you’ll be able to more at $150, lmfao!"
2025-08-30,The whole market is down today.  Investing is not day trading.   Long-term investors of NVDA have been handsomely rewarded so far.   Let’s see what the stock price will be at year-end and beyond.
2025-08-27,Shorts typically cover before earnings come out. Happened with APLD and NBIS too. THEN they react to earnings. It was positive for APLD and NBIS not so for CRWV
2025-08-28,"This guy is smart. I'm following him haha

Also don't forget any commentary about Blackwell B30 is bullish regardless of the H20 situation"
2025-08-27,"A lot of material for market to react negative

I'm beginning to feel certain stock will spike as market euphoria kicks in"
2025-08-27,Its all about the guidance imo. Price will react to that regardless of the quarters numbers.
2025-08-27,To answer your questions it will give the market a break. Nine out of every 10 >August to October is always the worst time of the year. This will be a great excuse for profit taking and for the hedges to reallocate and to take a breather and to test current lows again ; I expect around 170 by the end of the week And to trickle down from there and until October. IBM used to run the markets in the 80s up until 2008 AAPL moving forward and now it’s Nvidia.
2025-08-27,"the spillover effects on the other companies you listed make me more confident in being in the S&P 500 today/tomorrow than playing NVDA earnings day roulette

Godspeed to everyone holding"
2025-08-28,"Remember, without any stock splits, this stock would be at $87,000 per share!!  Even just considering the recent 10:1 split, the stock would be at around $1,800 per share.  Given just that, the stakes are super high.  A reality check is in the works at tomorrow’s open.  This is not to suggest NVDA is not a good company.  It’s just overvalued."
2025-08-27,they goin start selling leather jackets soon too
2025-08-27,$190 is nothing. $250 will be inbound shortly 
2025-08-27,I find the stock's one day reaction following earnings has little to do how the stock does over time the last few years. Trust in having a long term view on underlying fundamentals.
2025-08-28,"Hyperscalers have reported NVDA revenue in aggregate by reporting capex. My conclusion over the last decade, it is always a mistake to sell NVDA."
2025-08-27,Price is going to climb towards the second part of the trading day before tanking in the AH. Recover back to the current levels within 1-2 weeks. This has happened for the  last 3-4 earnings reports for NVDA.
2025-08-27,"As predicted, MMs are keeping it flat for the day. I see a slow pump for the next few days until everyone's options expire worthless."
2025-08-28,"Get some RR, who is partnered with NVDA for robotics.."
2025-08-27,"Gonna be a blowout earnings, even without China revenue. Book it."
2025-08-28,Despite the good earning .. The stock may see drop because the expectation is extremely high
2025-08-28,"Long term hold for at least until 2028. 
But it back in the day for $ 28 a share. 
So I’ve seen first hand all the people that say it’s going to tank or flat line.  
Well it hasn’t in the years I’ve held and it’s around 73% of my portfolio"
2025-08-28,"This is bad, and then China is going to pull another DEEPSEEK type move and things will really drop."
2025-08-27,It’s going to tank. Stock has had an Insane push higher and it’ll need to blow out every analyst expectation significantly which is extremely hard. Even a small beat will tank this stock. Guarantee next couple of days people will say to buy more on the dip and long term this stock and not to worry about fundamentals. Have fun holding this stock for another 10-20 years
2025-08-27,I’m selling all at $250
2025-08-28,"\> Trust in having a long term view on underlying fundamentals.

Geezus, don't you get it?  It's about nothing but instant gratification!  😉"
2025-08-27,You're being too extreme here. Yes it does tend to tank after earnings but typically recovers within several days.
2025-08-28,I’m too attached to the shares to sell… Anything below $720 and I’m holding. 4-5x current value by 2030 is my wishful thinking.

2025-08-27,"I think it'll run up to earnings then sell off, but I know absolutely nothing."
2025-08-27,After earnings so you know if you are up or down from current price. All seriousness you cannot time the market!
2025-08-27,"If you’re not already in NVDA from lower prices, playing earnings is a pure gamble. So, decide how much you’re willing to lose and place your bet. Heads, you win. Tails, you lose."
2025-08-28,I purchased on April 7th for under $95. But I guess April 4th would have been even better.
2025-08-28,"Buy now, before end of day today - tomorrow this thing ripping for sure iA 
Watch for any dips today and try to average down"
2025-08-28,"after earnings, que up calls aftermarket to buy at open if it tanks or if it goes up. Make them 3 months till expiration and just ride the wave back up"

2025-08-27,"Because I got high…

I didn’t get me order in on time and I know why…Because I was High, because I was high. 
Earnings were off the hook and I know why, Jensen gets plenty high, his mind is an algorithm that shows him “oh that’s why.” The price will always rise and dat be no surprise when you so high!"
2025-08-27,"I don't know anything 😂. I find that if I fret about the small dips, it causes lots of stress. Better to go with the mindset of 'I 100% believe in this company, so I am going to invest in it'. Then even if the price goes down a bit, you don't need to worry. The trouble with the stock market is that, depending on which way the wind is blowing today, the price will either rise or fall. However, something solid like Nvda will always go up. So trying to time when to buy it next to impossible. Maybe just buy 3k before, and 3k after earnings. Then you average out both scenarios! Good luck to you"
2025-08-27,If you are going to invest long term then it doesn’t really matter when you do it. If this is a short term gamble then no one on here ‘knows’ the best time. It’s all just opinion and educated guesses.
2025-08-27,Yes. Once it hits 5T the news is going to be everywhere. Which we may see today.
2025-08-27,No. Bearish.
2025-08-27,"usually the expectations are already priced in before the earnings, so imo its going down as always"
2025-08-27,I am sure big guns will invest for a while to make it reach 194 and then take out with slight loss just to have fun.
2025-08-27,"After a few earnings burns, I decided to treat the earnings like firework events.   
It can be a new year countdown New York event or Alabama native Timmy the Grump with bang snaps.  
Either way, I am watching instead of joining.

With that being said, NVDA earnings ALWAYS beat the expectation and some.   
It's just that investors seem to have their own metric(or maybe they were always going to sell unless something \*dramatic occurs) and I refuse to be at the mercy of whales' decisions.

\*Oddly enough, you would think NVDA has brought that dramatic something something"

2025-08-27,They’re right about the size of Nvidia. I’d go for a small market cap stock. Something everyone is talking about and retail’s been doing active dd’s lately. Don’t go for a meme stock. Try going for a sector that will have tons of growth in the next 5-10 years. Lidar Technology for example. I’ve invested in $LIDR. You can look into that and others.
2025-08-27,"I admit that I normally do not go more that 5-7% in any one stock. But because of a couple splits, I am at 41% Nvidia. A 1:4 then a 1:10 did it.  On April 8th I put $5k in and raised my average from $47 to $81 and I am glad that I did"

Then find a handful of companies that you are familiar with or excited about. Find a reliable source for determining a FMV and use AI to help you quickly summarize a number of analysts reports. The main idea here is to find companies that you really believe in for the long haul and then wait for a wonderful price. Then and only then would I invest in a company."
2025-08-27,Just wait a few days post earnings when NVDA dips

If you’re under 30 and all you got is $1000 and you want to give it a shot; go for it. You’ll only regret what you haven’t done later in life. 

One of my biggest regrets is knowing I could have put in 10k into Nvidia in 2021 but chose to only do 2k. Ever since then I’ve made efforts to move with a bit more conviction."

90% of the significant growth took place in the last 6 years. When the value of a company was at those levels it could grow and multiply. The issue with 4T market cap and large numbers… they become significantly harder to multiply. 

Google basics of large numbers, then the global monetary supply. Right now, Nvidia is around 17% of the market cap of Gold for example. 

If you expect growth from $1000 you are too late. You could see $2000 in 5/10 years. FYI, at $2000 the company would be worth double ($8T)."

2025-08-27,"If valuation truly matters to the stock price, how come tesla stock is about 2x nvidia's when their company valuation is at about 1T? Or palantir being at 160ish, with 370ish billion valuation?"
2025-08-28,One call for this Friday was 500$ he could get 2 of them
2025-08-28,"You go trade shares with a 1000$. You’ll have enough for cup of coffee at the end of the day. 
Options you could have around 600$ enough for a PlayStation which also has AMD hardware in it."
2025-08-27,"I never buy near the all time high.  Yeah, I know but not even Nvidia"
2025-08-27,"How old are you? Do you have any debt? What’s your investment tolerance risk? What’s your time horizon? 

You are only giving us 2 variables: you have money and you want to invest it. We can’t do much advising with such little information."
2025-08-28,It’s a fixed income asset you can buy through your online broker (at least most should allow you to)
2025-08-27,There is that aspect but in terms of what value there is in investing 1000 now. Seems pointless unless you’re holding to 2050
2025-08-27,"Not sure what point you think you’re making but it’s not the one I’m addressing. Volume of capital and large numbers become harder to multiply. Ie to 10x your investment from $1000 now… would be 40t market cap. 

No idea what you’re talking about 😅"
2025-08-28,This is bad advice man
2025-08-28,Options on crypto 2x etfs are better nowadays but yes with 1k do options to get a few more bucks then put it in amd or one of the other ai chip companies or you’ll be sitting there with 1500 in 2 years which is not bad you made 50 percent but its only 50 percent of 1k so you can with inflation basically be in the same place
2025-08-28,Did you notice the part about “first time?“ Telling someone to blow $1K on two contracts is braindead activity.
2025-08-27,"Personally I might agree, but I also can’t see *not* owning NVDA at all. I’m 57% invested in the company. But it didn’t start that way. 

I think it’s also important to note, that the SP500 has spent 44% of it time within 5% of its all time high."
2025-08-27,"I mean I guess it’ll go lower eventually, but there’s a chance tomorrow it’ll either jump or drop some. Either way I’m buying more, company is obviously very dominant"
2025-08-27,"Bitcoin wasn’t worth 4T when they said that lad. I’m not sure what’s hard to grasp here. 

Large numbers become harder to multiply. Ie to 10x your investment of $1000 like this guy is clearly dreaming off, would mean Nvidia was worth 40T… Google global monetary market cap. (It’s 400T~). Without inflation, it’s exceedingly unlikely. 

To other people’s points, there’s now better plays to make money. Coreweave might be that early entry this guy is looking for that’s linked to Ai. Even TSMC is better right now"
2025-08-28,If you have over 25k a margin account then you can trade stock and make money. If you have just 1000$ I’d do only options. You’re not going to make any meaningfully gains. If he does contracts he could double his money in the first couple days and then play accordingly building on that same 1000$. Some people aren’t trying to wait till 60 to enjoy life.
2025-08-27,That could be great but only if the first time investor is young
2025-08-27,"One more thing I learned with volatile companies like that & nvidia, never sell the rally before the earnings release"
2025-08-27,Many (not me) didn’t though they were saying and it was true that almost every trade all along for PLTR was at ATH.
2025-08-27,"There’s a post here explaining what it takes to double your investment right now... $1000 invested today, would need the company to hit 8T before you double your money. Think about that. 

People waiting till Nvidia was the only company to hit 4T before they think “hmm yes I’ll put my money here, this might be on to something” immediately signals you are slow (in a few respects) and always will be"
2025-08-27,Lower market cap companies with higher short term - medium term potential than NVDA. Not that hard to understand
2025-08-27,"I was answering the question the OP was asking.  $1000, first time?  If that was my case I would go with IREN or CIFR. I am glad I got into nvidia a couple splits ago in 2021"
2025-08-27,Yeah I ended up selling Palantir at a $6k loss because I’m big on opportunity cost and don’t like bag holding when I know I can make that loss back easily by reinvesting in a better stock. It was an expensive lesson but necessary
2025-08-28,"Yeah but think about the opposite side as well. Bitcoin, a crypto digital asset that a single person living in their mom’s basement can now build overnight is priced at $100k per coin. The masses don’t generally use it. If it disappeared tomorrow, it wouldn’t really affect everyone’s lives….

Now think about that vs building a AI gpu. Can a guy build it by himself overnight from scratch? What if all of the gpus vanished overnight? And bitcoin is valued at $100k per coin… the highest valued companies 10 yrs ago (appl $740B, goog $373B, msft $348B) are all worth 5-8x now at $3-4T…. If you are the biggest, doesn’t mean you still can’t dominate and back then people said the same thing “it’s at $300B (most valued company of all time) and it would take another $300B to double…” and they all did it in no time."
2025-08-27,Yes. Learn from those mistakes.  Don’t FOMO and don’t sell scared
2025-08-30,"I’m sure that made sense to you. The point is simple. Billions are able to multiply more easily than trillions. When you have stock in a company worth 4 trillion, it has to double in value for you to double your money. Ie… to your point it will take significantly longer. No more verticals and parabolic growth at these numbers bud"
2025-08-27,"Well, on April 8th 2025, you had a second chance.  Everything dropped out of ignorance of the tariff talk.  I borrowed $10k bought many stocks including Nvidia and today, I am up over $160k on that exchange.  I don’t buy into the tariff is bad narrative"
2025-08-27,I actually did buy about $50 worth on the 8th lol don’t have money to throw around like that. Though I do wish. Still up $70 from it so not too bad
2025-08-27,Tariffs aren’t bad if you use them strategically so when we slap blanket tariffs in the 500% range on all industries then yes you can absolutely do some major damage to the economy. It’s literally common knowledge that the smoot hawley tariff act was a major contributor to the Great Depression

2025-08-27,"Great job.  I started with $400 in 2021. But I borrowed $10k on 4/7 lucky me, I didn’t get the money until the 8th & market dropped even more.  A perfect storm for me that never happened before & likely won’t happen again for me.  Lol"
2025-08-27,"Everybody’s hyped (or spooked) on Trainium 4 chatter, but the bigger Q is AI optics vs custom ASIC contribution. If ASIC doesn’t cross >50% of AI rev by FY27, it’s dead money vs $NVDA/$AVGO. Mgmt needs to quit the smoke and mirrors—Street’s patience is thin, that’s why MRVL trades at a discount multiple."
2025-08-27,Never heard of that before but I have no doubt a company can achieve more than $5T
2025-08-27,"I went long, clear evidence of value."
2025-08-27,Must be all the tulips and tulip bulbs that helped the Dutch company reach that value
2025-08-27,I am worth 25trillion Nvidia is definitely undervalued.
2025-08-27,"Does NVDA has the ‘mother of all trades’ (moedernegotie)? Amsterdam became the staple market of Europe, meaning it stockpiled goods and controlled their distribution, manipulating supply and demand. NVDA is not able to do so because of anti-trust laws"
2025-08-27,To me as long as nvidia market cap is more than googles then its overvalued.
2025-08-27,"How was the Dutch East India Company $8T?

Why not just round up to an even $50T while you’re at it?"
2025-08-27,"I mean, technically Nvidia's market cap has increased by $4T in just 3 years... it's not impossible."
2025-08-27,Pretty confident they beat..I’ll probably trim 5% before the print..up 40% from last report and I think China dumpster fire will give the market a reason to trim.. hopefully we get 190.00 after hours
2025-08-28,Is this real? Damn didn't know colonialism is that insanely profitable
2025-08-28,"What people fail to understand and keep failing to understand is that NVDA has technology powering every single emerging field, has tech in every other Fortune 500 company and is the equivalent of if one company and one company only manufactured picks and shovels during the gold rush. You simply cannot compete with their architecture when doing high level data processing.

Basically a proper valuation is not possible."
2025-08-28,"It wasn’t a stock market cap like today’s companies have, but rather a mix of its monopoly charter, ships, colonial possessions, and trade revenues. Also, VOC’s wealth was tightly tied to the Dutch crown and global trade routes. It’s not the same as a modern publicly traded tech stock. It sounds cool, but it’s apples vs. cannonballs."
2025-08-30,"It's complete BS. The peak value of the DEIC was only \~$500 MILLION.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/xwgx64/no\_the\_dutch\_east\_india\_company\_voc\_was\_not\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/xwgx64/no_the_dutch_east_india_company_voc_was_not_the/)

In 1720 the entire global economy was only worth the equivalent of $2T. The Netherlands had \~0.3% of  the global population and only \~1% of the global economy"
2025-08-27,"After... That's what I learned in history class in my school in India. Of course, then the English East India company came along. The English eventually consolidated and drove away the Dutch, French, and the Portuguese. 

Any which way you look at it, though, this comparison is not so good because of what happened eventually to the East India companies in the larger scheme of things... Jus' sayin' 🤷"
2025-08-30,Blackrock manages $11T in assets. The company itself is worth about $175B.
2025-08-30,It is 100% made up. The source was an idiotic article in Motley Fool. The best estimates put the peak value at only $500 MILLION.
2025-08-30,"You’re cherry picking with the h100. Nvidia GB200 is far superior to any architecture that AMD has including the instinct line if you want to cherry pick. Just because they train on their proprietary hardware does not mean they don’t also use NVDA products as well every one of the companies you named are buyers. 

You might be tired of hearing about the opinions of bulls but bears have been wrong since they were calling it overvalued in 2020 and not a single bear can say they wouldn’t have bought it then if they could go back."
2025-08-27,"Nvda is already selling robot brains... it may not be too far out in the future that they have an army.

I get your point though, nvda doesn't have the need for a $4T army"
2025-08-30,"Anybody who has been following the stockmarket for less than  20 years has NFI about investment. They are ridiculously overconfident and think bears are idiots.

If you had followed NVDA history since 1998 you would know their success has always been little more than dumb luck (and stupid mistakes by competitors). Academics found uses for CUDA in the early 2010s. Then BTC and finally AI (which is 99% hype). NONE of it  was anticipated  by Nvdia. In every case sales  and the stock price have crashed when their niche demand collapses."
2025-08-27,"If they can continue to grow revenue and maintain their profit margins, a 5T valuation in 2026 isn't unreasonable.   We'll see which way they are headed soon!"
2025-08-30,"Ok grandpappy, the rest of the world will keep making money you go ahead and short the future."
2025-08-29,So I should care about a company or trade from 225 years ago?  How is that going to help my investments today?  🙄 foreign wars and outdated information from that long ago is not relevant to me.  Lol
2025-08-27,It's in the money and worth $7.75 (which is very high). What did you pay for it? There's a good chance it prints before 9/5
2025-08-27,This makes me feel real good about my puts. I can already envision myself walking into the Porsche dealership Thursday afternoon
2025-08-27,Wtf is a green fute
2025-08-27,Green fuute sounds like something I used to buy for a rave
2025-08-27,Put it all on red.
2025-08-27,You dont have enough money to buy Wendy's if you win dude...
2025-08-27,He's got the clap.   Green futes on an ok day...  Red futes and he's in 🔥🔥🔥🔥
2025-08-27,If I win I can finally afford to take my girlfriend to cheesecake factory
2025-08-27,Tis the earnings season
2025-08-27,"Investors asleep all snug in their beds, while visions of dollar signs danced in their heads."
2025-08-27,It’s going to drop and I’m going to buy more
2025-08-27,Whenever expectations are so high it normally drops all the liquidity is on the buy side so dropping the market will be more profitable for market makers rather than bringing it up
2025-08-27,I’m adding on the post earnings dip!
2025-08-27,Didn't nvidia go red after earnings the last few times?
2025-08-27,"Doesn’t matter if NVDA smashes earnings. They likely will.

But will they say anything in the guidance that will give investors sitting on 70% gains in the past 4 months and a double off the lows a reason to take profits?

NVDA is the greatest company in the world, I own shares long-term I will likely never sell. However, those taking additional positions at current prices in the hopes the stock reacts positively are gambling, plain and simple.

I hope it works out, but don’t believe the reaction is going to be rational or expected. This is the stock market."
2025-08-27,Me and you too. I started with $4k calls in May. Up to $40k and YOLOing it through earning despite the high probability of trading sideways even on good results. Expires 19-Sept. let’s go.
2025-08-27,"Objectively speaking, expectations are just too high, a “solid” report is not gonna be enough to keep the increase momentum going, so I expect it to drop then climb back up, a bit like AMD’s earnings"
2025-08-27,Hopefully your calls don't expire tomorrow. Some stocks drop even on great earnings reports.
2025-08-27,"They say: either 6% up or 6% down! 

I think up. Only thing im scared of is that trump has his orange finger in it now and that scared away China. We will see"
2025-08-27,I just hope trump doesn’t say anything negative tomorrow like he did during AMD earnings day.
2025-08-27,Undoubtedly more young option traders trying to get rich quick and not knowing what they are doing will drag the stock down after another stellar earnings report.
2025-08-27,"$200 end of day tomorrow, mark my words boys"
2025-08-27,"Broke.  Earnings may best but the rate of earnings growth (or acceleration ) might slow .. there are scattered anecdotes of reigning in run away spending on AI .. if not this quarter, then next quarter"
2025-08-27,"Only do shares, IV crush incoming"
2025-08-27,hope it dips so i can keep buying more 🤣
2025-08-28,Options market is predicting a 6% swing. You won't be filthy rich or poor by the end of today
2025-08-27,"By how much do you expect NVDA to go up? I mean, come on… you don’t expect $200-$400 increase tomorrow seriously 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
2025-08-27,"I hate what you are saying but it is correct. I can't even imagine how many call options are riding on these earnings which is a perfect recipe for MMs to crash these earnings. On the other hand NVDA is 8% of SPY so they can't keep it down for too long. I only have some call options for Feb 2026, and rest is in shares so not worried. Someone on WSB said that these earnings seem like a season finale and it certainly feels like it."
2025-08-27,Not last earnings.
2025-08-29,How have you made your money?  Just keep selling puts?  Or trading calls?  What has your strategy been?  Good work!
2025-08-27,Focus on the earnings report for now
2025-08-27,You think young option traders have the buying power to move the price action on a 4T market cap company?
2025-08-27,Not using options bro shares only
2025-08-28,IV crush mostly happens when you are directionally wrong on the option earnings play. Calls will print if it moves higher. Puts will print if it goes lower.
2025-08-27,"If you own shares of Nvidia,  not everything!  Hahaha"
2025-08-27,Hmm no proof and without a logical reason you call him that?  Wow.  I have turned less than $10k into over $100k since April 8th thanks to people listening to propaganda against tariffs…
2025-08-27,Wow you are so cool! Read something different then fox News bro
2025-08-29,"I am a long term buyer, I bought $5k @ $92 of Nvidia.  Not sure if I can say the others without getting banned here but a Nvidia competitor, a few companies that will be providing power for AI and quantum computing.  Also was able to get allocated shares from three very good recent IPOs.
I have taken profits and invested deeper into those power and quantum computing companies"
2025-08-27,"I don’t follow fox news.  But in this country, a person is innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around & only the propagandists who are hoping to get him on anything in the universe are saying he has done that.  Don’t you know if the people who did all they have done to him had that on him with actual proof, they would have rolled it out already? Dude, get a clue.  He’s gone in 3 years, he beat all the liars let it go"
2025-08-27,"Thats whats wrong in your country “let it go”. There is so much evidence against him, you guys should never let a child predator go! 

But i leave it with this, I really hate talking with MAGA. You sounds like a good guy but it messes me up that what everything trump does and say people still defend him! Its not worth my mental health to have a discussion with someone like that! Have a good night sir and Lets hope we get good News tomorrow"
2025-08-27,"This is an NVDA sub.  Not a casual hangout for the green and purple haired anti Orange-ists.

He exists.  He's Pres.  He farts out tariffs that none of us like.   Deal with it."
2025-08-27,"If it goes up, we make money. If it goes down, you buy the dip. What luck? It's a win-win."
2025-08-27,"I expect earnings to beat expectations. Outlook for 2026 increased and cash reserve to be size of a small country and the stock will drop 10 dollars.

😉"
2025-08-27,I bought back in last week at 174 so I’m hoping for something good
2025-08-27,"I’m with you brother. 28% of my portfolio in NVDA.  I’m up 258%, but still want to ride this wave out.  Definitely a bit of FOMO if I sell and NVDA takes off further."
2025-08-27,$200 tomorrow
2025-08-27,Quit freaking out baby child's. Hold hold hold on and NVDA will set you free!!!!  I mean come on. You don't even need to know how to use excel anymore because AI gonna do da shifty shit
2025-08-27,"Buy on rumor, sell on news.   This is what I have always heard!"
2025-08-27,Try to tune in to the earnings call. Forward guidance is a huge factor in stock price movement.
2025-08-27,You gonna be good into end of year for sure. Tomorrow could be up or down 5 % big deal. Look out longer term. Nvda is the boss. Volatile yes but solid earnings revenues are its future. Why because the god gather wrapped it all up. That's why you bought in right
2025-08-27,Going into their earnings without holding good number of their stocks feels like going to a cocktail party naked!
2025-08-27,"Usually if it runs up before earnings, there’s a small sell off right after but rebounds quickly…"
2025-08-28,"Even if earnings are beaten, NVDA is going down short term because it’s priced in. If they aren’t, then we’re going to see a hell of a dip coming for all AI stocks.

Opinion not to be taken as fact."
2025-08-27,Stop loss! Earnings might be ruff
2025-08-27,Earnings surprise incoming
2025-08-27,He is 100% a gambler because earnings.
2025-08-27,"Usually but not always. It also ran up to earnings before May 2023 earnings where it then rocketed 30%. 

Not that it will do that now but we could crack 200."
2025-08-27,Get ahold of yourself son. You buy a stock because you LIKE it. So shape up.
2025-08-27,Red or black on roulette?
2025-08-27,"NVDA is priced for perfection anything less than perfection will send the price down as much as 6%. On the other hand, if it is a perfect print, the price could jump as much as 6%. Personally, I’m selling puts at $170 and hoping I end up owning the stock for that. If I do, I’ll sell covered calls on it."
2025-08-27,bull put spread and a bear call spread
2025-08-27,Rub the right one maybe it’ll tell you. Not a bad idea to know the reason right???
2025-08-27,Because nobody knows man. If we knew shit like this we wouldn’t be hanging around Reddit subs I can promise you that.
2025-08-26,Buy 10 of them
2025-08-27,My name Jeff I buy put
2025-08-26,"'I'd expect PUT option for this stock to be cheap' 

Why? IV spike before earnings normally increases options pricing"
2025-08-27,"Ok I played a straddle last month I bought the 114 call 177 break even,I used a put and keep rolling it up yesterday 82,5 , they are both green ,tomorrow I may roll up again if I can,so I can lose 700 or gain 5000,it's trying to pull a win win"
2025-08-26,"I swear, half the people on this sub gamble as opposed to invest"
2025-08-26,"It is cheap as you’re controlling $18,000 worth of stock with that contract…"
2025-08-27,"I think we will see big swings to both upside and downside.  What you are noticing on put pricing is that your thesis is wrong.  There is a lot of both upside and downside risk. 

Investors are trying to grapple with the idea that ai is in a bubble.  The MIT report on top of OpenAI terrible GPT 5 release along with CEO saying it’s a bubble.  Then add in China saying they don’t want/banned? H20.  Now on top of that add on firing of fed governor.  On top of that tariff impacts and all the other chaos in the macro environment."
2025-08-26,Anyone care to ELI5?  I’m not interested in participating but I’d be interested in following along.
2025-08-26,I buy cheap calls anytime I can. Just because.
2025-08-27,"I dont have any spare cash. If I did Id buy a put or two on NVDA. I believe in the stock long term but even good earnings people seem to take profits and it dips. 


So Id buy a few short term puts on NVDA. If the stock dips after earnings the put makes money I sell and buy some shares. If the stock runs my put goes to zero and my shares make money. 


Its a small calculated risk. "
2025-08-27,"ER is always a gamble depending on commentary , eps , guidance and alot of other factors. Most importantly what the majority does is all that moves the stock. Same way a heavily shorted stock go's up in a short squeeze."
2025-08-27,The current price already has the expected earnings built-in. That's why it's run from $94 to $182 in the last 4 months.
2025-08-27,"I feel like a stock price movement of +/- $10 is possible in the next 24 hours, I think options either way are going to get wrecked"

2025-08-28,"I am buying calls and puts, a “straddle “."

2025-08-27,"Say it with me

*ITS-ALREADY-PRICED-IN*"
2025-08-27,"I expect better from this sub!

You should be telling him to go out and load up on options buying them on margin.

😂"
2025-08-26,"He said he expects it to sky rocket, yet he’s buying a put near the money, surprised it’s expensive.
A) if you expect the stock to sky rocket you should sell a put, not buy it. His put will plummet in value if the underlying goes up. Alternatively you can buy a call, or just.. I don’t know.. buy the stock. 
B) it’s near the money, near the money calls or puts are going to be expensive due to high probability of being ITM, so his shock in the expense further demonstrates his entire lack of knowledge in how options work.  Hope you’re reading this OP, go back to Wendy’s, or do more reading."
2025-08-26,"Option pricing is all about volatility and expected moves, nvdia earnings are tomorrow and therefore the stock has a high potential to gap up or down, hence the high option premium"
2025-08-27,"Not really, you can see the option losing money and cut your losses. 

You can see the marble slowing down but can’t do a damn thing about as it lands on red. 

All gone right now vs some gone a little later 🤷🏼‍♂️"
2025-08-27,"People who get it, also lose money.

Nothing beats just buying and holding"
2025-08-27,"I agree, the stock pricing has all this baked in.  Or at least going through the process of accepting/rejecting price levels.  It is naive to believe you know what is and what is not priced in.  

He is talking about options pricing, not the price of the underlying stock (NVDA).  What he was expecting is that Puts would be vastly cheaper relative to calls, showing a strong skew to the upside.  What his observations show is the market is pricing in roughly a 6-7% up or down move from earnings.  

What most people are pointing out to him is a large component of options pricing is volatility (not just price direction).  

Leading into earnings you get higher IV but after earnings a lot of the uncertainty goes away and as such you get IV crush (short term options).  So he is paying a big premium prior to earnings and IV crush could crush the value of his options to a greater degree then what he would make if the stock price goes down."
2025-08-27,"You missed it, I say a call is very expensive right now,if you think it's going up,learn what the difference is between a put and a call does before you lose money,it's not a good feeling"
2025-08-26,"I see this more as a buying opportunity. I agree we could see a 5%–7% dip, but there’s a 99% chance we’ll break above $200 before year’s end."
2025-08-26,Just hold and buy the dip. If it dips.
2025-08-26,"You cite two quarters as examples of a historical “market chrash” after earnings. 2 quarters?C’mon man, do better."
2025-08-26,"If it ""chrashes"" I buy.

If it goes up I buy.

I buy because I believe in the company, their products and their vision, and I'm not a little bitch."
2025-08-26,"Earnings can be good, but if guidance isnt great or if it doesnt beat expectations by a mile things can go south in the short term."

They will beat their earnings!"
2025-08-26,Anyone else think selling covered calls with a Friday expiration is a smart move right now?

2025-08-27,Why should we care at all.  What happened since then....oh the price keeps going up.  I don't care if it drops 6 or 7 and 20% if it bounces back and then surpasses right after like it has always done.  Oh you forgot to add that part in.
2025-08-27,"I think subliminally meant CHACHING but fear got in the way?
I bought 30 shares @$177 as a test to my fear. Outside of what I own already. Hold until day or 2 after earning. Then sell if it begins to go south."

2025-08-26,"Analysis from Chat GPT:
Here’s the current stock snapshot for Nvidia (NVDA):

⸻

NVDA Stock Performance: Last Three Years
	•	Over the past three years, Nvidia has delivered an astonishing total return of approximately 1,217% — soaring from roughly $10.81 (around October 2022) to today’s ~$179–184 range  ￼.
	•	Year-to-date in 2025, the stock is up around 34%–33.9%  ￼.
	•	Annual performance highlights:
	•	2023: +246%
	•	2024: +179%
	•	2025 (so far): +30%  ￼.

This explosive growth is largely fueled by surging demand for AI-related chips and Nvidia’s dominance in data center GPUs  ￼.

⸻

What to Expect Post-Earnings (Tomorrow, August 27, 2025)

Market Expectations & Analyst Sentiment
	•	Expected results:
	•	EPS around $1.01
	•	Revenue near $46 billion, representing ~53% year-over-year growth  ￼ ￼.
	•	Strong analyst optimism:
	•	Most analysts maintain “Buy” ratings.
	•	Average price target: ~$203 (about 13% above current levels)  ￼ ￼.
	•	Bullish estimates from Baird ($225), Stifel ($212) alongside others like Morgan Stanley, UBS, Wedbush improving outlooks  ￼.
	•	Options market implies potential volatility:
	•	Anticipated post-earnings move in the range of ±6%, implying possible trading between $168–$191  ￼.
	•	A recent Reuters analysis estimates a ~$260 billion swing in market cap — a sign of high sensitivity to earnings outcome  ￼.

Key Drivers Post-Report
	1.	AI demand and data center strength
Continued strong interest from hyperscalers (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon) supports demand for AI infrastructure  ￼.
	2.	Guidance on China business
Nvidia’s commentary on progress with H20 chip sales to China—and regulatory dynamics—will be closely watched  ￼.
	3.	Valuation pressure
NVDA trades at a high forward P/E (~40× vs. Nasdaq 100 average of 28×) — meaning any underwhelming guidance could trigger steep downside  ￼.
	4.	Macro context
Analysts highlight that an earnings miss could ripple beyond Nvidia, potentially impacting overall market sentiment given the stock’s weight in indices like the S&P 500  ￼ ￼.

⸻

Summary Table: What Could Happen After Earnings

Scenario	What Could Happen
Strong beat & upbeat guidance	Stock could rise up to ~10%–15%, approaching analyst targets ($200–$225).
In-line results, cautious commentary	Expect modest moves (~±6%), with sideways to slightly upward drift.
Disappointing results or weak outlook	Price could fall 5–10%+, potentially down toward $168 or lower.


⸻

Bottom Line

Given Nvidia’s stellar track record and continued AI leadership, a solid earnings report and optimistic guidance could drive the stock meaningfully higher. However, its high valuation and sensitivity to guidance—especially around AI demand and China exposure—mean even small misses could result in pronounced declines.

Tomorrow’s earnings release (after markets close on August 27, 2025) will be pivotal. Expect a potential ~6% move, with upside capped by already ambitious forecasts, and downside risk magnified by market expectations and valuation scrutiny."
2025-08-26,Shouldn’t the smartest move be to than sell today before earnings and jump in after the dip tommorow
2025-08-26,If only the market were so predictable.
2025-08-26,"Yeah if we are so sure that it's going down temporarily, then why not recommend sell some  now and buy back later?"
2025-08-26,"My argument is for directly after earning, not long term, that 
 it will drop a lot which it has done in the past, im not arguing that nvidia wont ho up long term"
2025-08-26,I would sell everything and leverage everything to buy puts in that case.
2025-08-26,$500 and 3 splits
2025-08-26,"AI will mature in that time and they will have to pivot to stay relevant. With good leadership they will probably stay a tech giant (maybe continue to be in mag7) but probably more like a Tesla, just sitting in the background, still doing well but nothing like their rise in the last few years"
2025-08-27,$20 trillion market cap that's assuming a below average 5% compound annual growth rate
2025-08-27,"This is a tough question because part of me wants to be Uber optimistic and cheer for the team, the other part of me wants to be realistic and say that things play out and you'll see some stabilization and it's going to be a part of our world for a long time that's for sure, however since the future is unknown and change inevitablebut when I look back historically at some of the stocks that I've owned for a long time take GE for instance. GE for well over 20 years was a darling over that time but it flattened out and took some big hits and reverses. When i was holding the stock, i guess i figured take my gains and divest, had i held it when it was rocky, it would have doubled maybe tripled with dividend's, spin off special dividend's, splits and reverse splits.  By the same token, timing the market just in the last 3 years -- it's grown x10.  put on the other hand take a stock like Microsoft now Microsoft obviously was in the technology industry which was fairly new at the time and huge huge darling back then but look at it today it continues to be a darling and you know one of the most upward facing stocks on par with NVDIA.  Sorry for the rambling, but lots to unpack here in terms of long term investment strategy.... Oh ans and I didn't even speculate whether or not NVDIA would continue to be an innovator beyond the birth of AI...."
2025-08-27,"I think it’s gonna be the top 10, maybe top 3, biggest company in the world. I do think that Google will eventually surpass NVDA in due time. In the long long run. With that said I have about 2.5 times the amount of NVDA that I have of GOOGL atm."
2025-08-26,The value of the dollar will collapse and it will be valued against Ethereum/btc/gold or some other thing.
2025-08-26,"At the rate we’re going, and with what’s going on in the world, especially based on the last 5 years…personally I don’t think it will look like anything, as I don’t see mankind making it another 30 years, and the animals are not subject to the social construct of the dollar as ‘we’ are. 

However, if I’m still alive and well, I’ll still be holding, but I couldn’t tell ya why."
2025-08-26,"Are you looking for NVDA stock price forecasts? An interesting tool is here:  [https://longforecast.com/nvidia](https://longforecast.com/nvidia)

However it does not go that far forward - a good thing as it is impossible to know."

I think the red and green futes issue you are confusing with a classic venereal disease flareup.

I truly see very few companies out there innovating and growing this well. The leadership at Nvidia gives me peace of mind knowing my money is in great hands."
2025-08-26,I think nvda is going to sell off and start a whole market selloff. I currently have no skin in the game but I’d love to buy back in around 130-140 range. Anything below 130 would be a steal.
2025-08-27,Yeah I’m probably going to sell around $220

2025-08-26,"Problem is that current AI based earnings are struggling to justify current growth projections. Nvidia will be doing well as long as companies are willing to keep buying more shovels but the moment this investment into the future slows down, you’re gonna see a heavy correction.

down those multiples will start to compress and nvidia will dump a lot, it’d be a huge change in market sentiment.

I remember after the dot com crash Microsoft went from being the most valuable company at 600 billion to almost half that before recovering, it’s still scary how similar NVDAs run up has felt to MSFT"
2025-08-25,The rally needs a break. Who cares what happens short term ( a few months) if next year nvidia will be at 200+?

2025-08-25,"To the commenters saying this is a bear trap, y’all don’t know.  If you look at the logarithmic NVDA price chart, it looks more like a bull trap.

The [MIT study](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) may just pop the AI bubble.

“It interviewed 150 executives, surveyed 350 employees, and looked at 300 individual AI projects. It found that 95% of AI pilot projects failed to deliver any discernible financial savings or uplift in profits. These findings are not actually all that different from what a lot of previous surveys have found—and those surveys had no negative impact on the stock market. Consulting firm Capgemini found in 2023 that 88% of AI pilots failed to reach production. (S&P Global found earlier this year that 42% of generative AI pilots were abandoned—which is still not great).”"

2025-08-25,"All depends how large your portfolio is.  If its sub $100k and you're young, I myself would go 100% VGT.  You need to grow your money and it's not gonna happen in VOO or the market unless you're contributing a lot a week.  Like maybe $500 or $1000 a week.

I've beat the market for 15 years by mostly just holding large cap tech.  So all my money is basically weighted to the top of VGT or something.

Don't listen to people that say tech is risky, cause really they're the best companies out there and everyone knows it.  Long term the top tech stocks will easily outperform everything else."

2025-08-25,Difference is that Nvidia actually releases good products and it more in line with what it's worth. AMD on the other hand sells just about half of what Intel does but is worth 3x as much. Algos controlling AMD.
2025-08-25,"AMD's 100 P/E is a result of the acquisition of Xlinix, where the Xlinix intangible assets are amortized.  Adds to AMD's expenses and reduces earnings, thus, increasing P/E.  Also, I usually look for Forward P/E in growth and semis.  AVGO, for example, has like a 200 P/E ratio from their acquisition of VMWare."

2025-08-25,"Revenue alone doesn't tell the story for AMD/Intel.  AMD's revenue was up 14% in 2024 to 25B, while Intel's declined 2% to 53B.  AMD is profitable off that 25B of revenue, while Intel had a net loss of 20B.  If you bought a car for 23k and sold it for 25k, that would be better than buying a car for 70k and selling it for 53k.  NVDA is clearly in a league of its own, generating 61B in revenue with a net profit of 30B.  But that's also the reason it's valued at 15-16x the size of AMD."
2025-08-26,FYI 85 analyst's have a buy call on nvda
2025-08-25,"The Xilinx deal was in 2022, but AMD has to spread the cost over ~15 years. That’s why the accounting still drags down earnings even now."
2025-08-24,These things follow patterns. It will come down at some point soon. The sector is very toppy. Doesn’t mean you’re not right though.
2025-08-25,$AMD up next tho
2025-08-25,Investors are going to be fooled again. It will most certainly drop immediately after earning. When it does I am buying some more LEAPS.
2025-08-24,"Nvidia is the king of AI Hardware management. Balancing between TSMC & SuperMicro/Foxconn is only done by few like Apple, Nvidia & Google. Nvidia is winning by larger because your fckng GB200 NVL72 sells for 3 Million $ & everyone has ordered 5K-15K."
2025-08-25,"AMD is coming up quick. I have invested in both (nvda and AMD) . Doesn’t have to be just one, even though NVDA is king."
2025-08-25,I'm buying 2028 leaps when available.
2025-08-25,This is Reddit
2025-08-24,That new info is old news. B30A is in the pipe.
2025-08-25,I just keep buying the long dated. Wait until the earning drop though.
2025-08-25,"Oh, I know the earnings routine."
2025-08-25,I'm waiting for  a bitcoin drop to buy a long leap on ibit.
2025-08-24,"If you believe in NVDIA and want to invest in it monthly, but also diversify, then look into SCHG and SPMO."
2025-08-24,"I’m gonna give you non-Nvidia related advice. You’re a kid so it’s good you’re looking into this. Keep investing, but focus on paying down or preventing as much debt as possible. As soon as you are working full time start building a savings cushion and maxing out a Roth IRA and any money you have left over invest as you wish. Just keep in mind that there’s always going to be all time highs and there’s always going to be bears saying the end is coming. I keep extra money in savings so if things go south I’m covered and I can average that money in over the course of any economic slump or if things go sideways. Also as time goes on you can sell of shares equal to the cost of buying into a position and move to another growth stock you like and keep your remaining shares for free. This is obviously only if the stock really increases in price over time.
Also, when you get out of school, feel free to invest freely on whatever app or site you use, but it really is worth it to get an investment advisor. For the one percent or so commission they take they will always look out in your best interest with sound advice. You’re gonna be paying in some way shape or form, so you might as well have someone acting in your best interest"
2025-08-24,"Diversifying is for preserving wealth, not growing it. Were you holding any shares before the crash? If yes, how did you fare? Were you able to laugh at the noise and continue to buy, grateful for the discounts? Or was it your first time buying?

You won't know how you do during the next discount until it comes along, only then will you know if you're good at growing wealth, and getting rich, or if you're more suited for preserving what you work hard for."
2025-08-24,A lot would depend on how many shares you own.
2025-08-24,I’ll recommend holding long term. And then when you’re old enough someone will tell you to keep holding long term again and finally when your 70s someone else will enjoy the gains you held forever
2025-08-24,"Good job snagging NVDA early. Nothing wrong with adding monthly, but I’d sprinkle in a few other growth names or ETFs so you’re not riding one horse in the race."
2025-08-24,You might want to consider long dated LEAPS. A lot cheaper. With this particular stock you will do well.
2025-08-26,Buy long dates calls and don’t touch them.
2025-08-27,"For your age, unless you have more of a portfolio than NVDA, I strongly suggest you sell 5 NVDA shares a month and buy VOO. Then just keep buying VOO regularly as you can afford. Don’t stop. If you won’t need the money, would be best to put it into a Roth IRA and forget it until retirement."
2025-08-24,I was not holding any before the crash. I had some savings in cash and I was just waiting to get into the market and I got lucky asf. For growing wealth would you recommend just sticking to my belief in NVDA rather than index funds?
2025-08-25,"Isn’t that the “New” term Generally Wealth comes from. ?   I’m 6 months till 70, owned Apple since the early ‘80’s, I have other diversified investments, but Apple my largest .   I want to start selling blocks of 200-500 shares in 2026 - after Q1 2026 earnings However, for what it’s worth.  I was lucky buying one of the best Companies in the World.   Stock splits compile $$$$ if a stock has a test of time, the value is exponential.  NVDA is a great investment and should be for at least five more years.  Five years from Now the World will might - WILL change.  Predicting the Market.  LOL isn’t that for “The Smart Money” ?"
2025-08-24,"Just my thoughts but it will take you 3 years to get to 50 shares. Personally I would not worry about being diversified. 

I own 2500 shares and a few Walmart shares."
2025-08-26,"No announcement was made, hopefully Jensen will have some news tomorrow. But yes screw JPMorgan.  These guys love to hear themselves. Especially during earnings season and days before.  There is no slow down in capex and if it’s Trumps idea/request for Jensen to consider designing a higher tech chip that will pass the criteria to be sold to that market, you can bet it’s going to be a big card to play to settle things in China.  It’s clear that Huawei has precious little to offer."
2025-08-23,Just hold for 10 years! Then day to day stuff won’t matter.
2025-08-23,"NVDA earnings is not so much about what it earned this quarter (not to say that isn’t a factor), but more about the future.  Tariffs, political issues, China government, new applications of their technology, new services, etc.  those types of things get investors excited and driven to purchase (or sell) shares."
2025-08-23,"You are correct to be nervous. The reaction is often a “sell the news” event regardless of the numbers.

That said, if the market follows through on the Powell-induced euphoria, the market may be in a much better mood on Wednesday than it was for the past two weeks, which could help NVDA react positively, assuming they don’t drop any bombs about future guidance."
2025-08-23,"Nice dip this past week, get ready for Wednesday. Easy money for smart calls. 🚀 $200 in 2025."
2025-08-23,It will drop after earnings then Trump will announce the “Big Exemptions in Little China deal” by Friday late afternoon.  Stock rockets upward.  At least that’s my hope and not too far fetched.
2025-08-23,"That’s not going to happen here. When all the hyperscalers report a slowdown in cap spending on data centers, then NVDA sales might slow some, but that’s 5-10 years away, and as the GPU’s become more powerful and more energy efficient, older models will be replaced on a 3 to 5 year basis, just like everything else in IT. The more productive IT and AI make us, the less labor is needed. But instead of having much less people, there are other options like 4 day work weeks, or reassignments to revenue producing jobs. The jobs of the future might be more fulfilling as a result. Factory labor might also be more rewarding and a lot less drudgery. I see AI as a massive positive, as long as belligerent countries aren’t able to use AI to subjugate the whole planet."
2025-08-24,"If there's no correlation, why are you worried?

Also, don't put all your eggs in one basket and it won't even matter when earnings are reported."
2025-08-24,Will go down after earnings
2025-08-24,I remember stock doesnt move for two earning quater at $125. Its at ath so suspected samething happen.
2025-08-23,"Count on a drop over the next few weeks and you may get a nice surprise. Nvidia, just like all other companies, has some tough issues to navigate in the near future. It's a solid business that may be a tad overpriced at the moment"
2025-08-23,"Go all in. This whole talk about long term is subjective to your age. If you’re over 60, are you going to hold the stock 10 years? You won’t be able to enjoy your gains. If you’re not going to use your money someone will enjoy using it"
2025-08-23,"Jobs numbers, technology will eliminate jobs, people that weren't working during COVID still not working,have to wait for them to stop receiving government benefits,it's coming near you,a drop in interest rates will start to help small business, maybe get closer to be able to buy a place of their own,it should stop wage inflation, government debt gets cheaper to pay so they can add infrastructure jobs,and hope the unions don't put companies out of business hence robots, cash is coming into the US higher for the first time in a while,im looking for the next numbers Sept,I see a rate cut of 25% no real pullback to next year,as for nvda it will come down to guidance,it will be good,thats just me,25/% is nothing but a market mover,lol"
2025-08-24,"Earnings can be a total coin flip short term, but NVDA’s long-term trend is tied to AI demand and data center growth. If you’re truly long, the noise around one report shouldn’t shake you."
2025-08-24,"Here is my strategy, I’m selling 50% of my Nvidia right before the market closes. Hoping for 5 to 7% jump and get out of entire Nvidia position."
2025-08-24,"Man, I feel this. Earnings season anxiety is brutal it’s like waiting on an exam grade you can’t change. I’ve had stocks crush revenue/earnings and still drop 15% after hours, and it’s maddening.

Thing is, the market isn’t reacting to the EPS/revenue headlines they’re already priced in. What really matters is guidance (what they say about next quarter/year) and overall market vibe (fear vs. euphoria).

If you are interested in the tool I use, I left it in my profile. It's the one I use to make a lot of money every month.

What helps me: rereading why I bought the stock in the first place, not gambling on earnings (no last-minute buys/sells), and seeing dips as either a buying opportunity or a signal to re-check my thesis. Zooming out to the 3–5 year picture keeps me sane."
2025-08-24,Can’t wait for earnings to be over no matter the outcome just to stop getting these posts
2025-08-24,The stock has gone down the day after earnings more often than not only to rally back later. I would not focus much on earnings reaction volatility up or down.
2025-08-24,Jensen saying that they are suspending sales of the H20 to China and working on a scaled down version of Blackwell could cut the legs off the blowout earnings. We have seen this before.
2025-08-24,Earnings roulette is wild but dips on good companies are free discounts. Long game always wins.
2025-08-26,"Valuation and performance are so far disconnected that it doesn't matter any more.

It's all fake money anymore anyhow.

Case in point Ford  vs Tesla.  

TTM total revenue 185b vs 93b.
Market cap  47b vs 1.1T.

Nothing matters except the markets sentiment."
2025-08-23,Will trade sideways for a long time regardless
2025-08-23,"There is absolutely rhyme and reason.  Expectations for this stock are ridiculously high.  It’s a 4T company, with a T.  In order for the stock to keep going up they need to not only beat revenue expectations, but also critically, raise guidance.  Here is where it could fall short.  If and it does, youll see a 8-10% drop."
2025-08-23,"This is sound advice. 

If the stock goes up, our best problem to have is wishing we bought more in retrospect.

This game is more about risk tolerance than profit generation."
2025-08-24,"all tech discoveries can be used for good and bad in equal measure 

you can already see today companies announce job cuts and stock goes up, so in my opinion future is not so optimistic"
2025-08-24,would you invest next week or risk it now ?
2025-08-23,This! Have a feeling it will be 160ish - 180ish for a while. It takes a lot to go from $4Tn to $5Tn. Nvidia is priced for perfection and even more than perfection at the moment. May need a bit of a breather before the next leg up.
2025-08-24,"Sound like you know ur stuff, Reckon it’s gonna be up or down after earnings?"
2025-08-24,Nobody knows for sure. Opinions are good.
2025-08-24,I'm not buying NVDA before Thursday. After that we'll have to see where it's going. I have a few short puts in the $125-$135 range. They may get assigned but probably not
2025-08-24,"they are a 57 pe today but after earnings, they drop to PE 51. so next week 180 is like today 162 per share"
2025-08-24,So u reckon a dip after earnings?
2025-08-24,There’s no bubble if they are making money. Bubbles pop when there’s no earnings behind the price of the stock. Nvidia is making money hand over fist.
2025-08-24,It can go up. Or down. That's my prediction 😂
2025-08-24,"Risk Tolerance Definition: The degree of risk an individual, business, or investor is willing and able to accept in pursuit of their goals.

Risk Management is also important, but I was intentional with my word choice."
2025-08-23,"Yes, it's a tough balance. He mentioned that trying to keep an *average* of 2% inflation goal has changed to 2% at any given point. We're currently over 3%, and rising, inflation so the new policy would justify a hike. We all know this is real inflation and not transitory tariff inflation. Given a possible choice between stagflation or higher unemployment, there's only one option available for adult economists"
2025-08-24,Stocks can still be overvalued even if they are making crazy money
2025-08-24,Curious why? He made it clear inflation 2% target is off the table and their primary focus is jobs. Can’t be much clearer than that.
2025-08-23,"The hope is that even with 50-100 bpp worth of cuts, policy would still be restrictive enough to prevent runaway inflation.

No doubt, it’s a delicate time in the economy, and if inflation does persist or start to rise along with a weakening job market, a recession is likely, which would likely usher in a 10-20% correction in the market.

However, I think that is unlikely to happen before next year. I believe there is a strong chance the market will be 10-20% higher before the proverbial shit hits the fan."
2025-08-24,"Haha, exactly. I remember a few 'earnings' ago, nvda smashed the results by billions. Stock dropped! It wasn't enough billions. So I don't try to make sense of it. Over time, it increases, and that all we need to know."
2025-08-24,"Crazy ay, I guess if ur holding
Long term then these ups and downs are just a time to get in or out"
2025-08-24,"I see what ur trying to say, if you can’t handle the smoke, shouldn’t be in the kitchen in the first place, agree to disagree, it’s like the chicken or the egg. 

I just think most investors should already have some tolerance to stress and have a little patience. 

Management is more of a skill that takes time to build up and same with tolerance really, you come into the stock market with a built in risk tolerance. but I think realizing how deep the water is, is more important v.s how much water you can drink before you drown."

2025-08-22,"Counterpoint:

The 44° apex (convergence angle) isn’t just a number. It’s a structural inflection encoded into the market’s harmonic geometry. When you map the slope vectors, the sine (0.69) creates a bullish resonance field, but the cosine (0.72) overrides it with angular divergence, signaling a hidden liquidity fracture. This imbalance forces the price into a torsional coil, where order flow oscillates between trapped gamma hedging and delta decay. Notice how the apex compresses below the critical 45° symmetry line. That’s the point where bullish convexity flips into concavity, creating negative curvature in the price manifold. Add in the fact that the angle aligns with the arc tangent of the Bollinger bandwidth, and you’re staring at a fractal cascade setup.

The angle itself is also harmonically linked: 44° is one degree shy of 45°, which traders know as the Pythagorean equilibrium point: the only slope where price and time vectors balance perfectly. Falling short at 44° proves that bulls ran out of momentum before achieving harmonic resonance, which invariably resolves in volatility shears. Combine that with the Fibonacci overlay at 0.618 and 0.786 confluence zones, and you can see that this wedge isn’t consolidation, it’s compression before detonation. Market makers have already triangulated this imbalance into their gamma hedging, meaning once spot NVDA hits the angular trigger zone, we don’t see a breakout. We see a controlled unwinding straight down the order book. The 44° apex is historically the death angle, and every time cos > sin at convergence, intraday momentum implodes before lunch. That’s why this setup isn’t a call play at all. It’s a textbook 0DTE PUT detonation window, and today’s session is the only chance to catch it before theta grinds it into dust."
2025-08-22,China news changes every 5 minutes.
2025-08-22,"NVDA just broke out of that falling wedge, showing bulls might be back in control. TSMC stays the quiet AI backbone, and this setup hints at a possible retest of resistance near 182 if volume holds. Smart money sees both names as a paired long-term play."

2025-08-22,$175 I bought Wednesday at $0.95. I should have sold Thursday morning :(
2025-08-24,"No...what? There's almost no H100s in production. Where di you hear they were going to make H100's for China? That's almost completely phased out.

There's a B30 that they HOPE to be able to license(and likely will as Trump brought it up unprompted) but that'll likely require more negotiating and bullshit with Trump. 

And you've still got to go through China...who is telling their companies to not buy Nvidia.

So it's very much a concern right now. It's up to the whims of Trump to decide if they get to sell the B30(unless there's something I haven't heard and they're going to ramp the H100 back up...which would make no sense to me)."
2025-08-22,Something about it did not sound right. There’s always some horrible news before the earnings to bring the price down.
2025-08-23,did u hold

2025-08-22,"Nvidia’s suspension of the H20 chip in China is not a setback but an opportunity. It allows the company to pivot away from low-margin, politically constrained products and focus on its next-gen Blackwell chips. The move strengthens Nvidia’s global positioning, highlights its technological edge, and reduces dependency on China. In the long run, this makes Nvidia more resilient, diversified, and better aligned with higher-value markets. (Improved text by AI)."

UPDATE 5-Nvidia CEO in Taipei to visit TSMC, says in talks with US over new China chip

*

Jensen Huang's trip comes amid escalating US-China tech tensions 
*

Huang says decision on H20 successor is up to the U.S. 
*

Nvidia asks Foxconn to stop work related to H20 chip, sources say 
(Adds Nvidia to release results on Wednesday in paragraph 2, additional Huang comments in paragraphs 4 and 5) 
By Ben Blanchard and Wen-Yee Lee
TAIPEI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Nvidia <NVDA.O> CEO Jensen
Huang arrived in Taipei on Friday to visit chip foundry partner
TSMC <2330.TW>, as the world's most valuable company navigates
rising friction between Washington and Beijing over access to
its industry-leading AI chips.
His visit, just days ahead of Nvidia's earnings release on Wednesday, comes as the company has asked some of its suppliers to stop work related to the H20 chip following Beijing's caution over the chip's security risks, and as it develops a new AI chip tailored for the China market. 
""My main purpose coming here is to visit TSMC,"" he told reporters, adding that he would only stay a few hours and leave after dinner with TSMC leaders, according to a live feed broadcast by local media at Taipei's Songshan airport, where he landed in a private jet. 
He also said TSMC had asked him to deliver a speech. TSMC said in a statement that Huang would give an internal speech on his ""management philosophy"". It did not elaborate. 
Huang said he came to thank TSMC, where they have taped
out six brand-new chips, including a new GPU and a silicon
photonics processor for Nvidia's next-generation
Rubin-architecture supercomputers. Tape out refers to finalizing
the design of a chip so production can begin.
 
""This is the first architecture in our history where
every single chip is new and revolutionary,"" he said. ""We've
taped out all of the chips.""
 
U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month opened
the door to the possibility of more advanced Nvidia chips beyond
the H20 being sold in China, and reached a deal with Nvidia and
AMD <AMD.O> under which the U.S. government would receive 15% of
the revenue from sales of some advanced chips in China.
Reuters this week reported that Nvidia was working on a new chip tentatively named the B30A based on its latest Blackwell architecture that will be more powerful than the H20 model. 
Asked about the B30A, Huang said Nvidia was in talks with the U.S. over offering China a successor to its H20 chip, but that it was not the company's decision to make. 
""It’s up to, of course, the U.S. government, and we are in dialogue with them, but it is too soon to know."" he said. 
Nvidia only received permission in July to recommence sales of the H20. It was developed specifically for China after export restrictions were put in place in 2023, but the company was abruptly ordered to stop sales in April. 
Shortly after Washington's greenlight, Nvidia placed orders for 300,000 H20 chips with TSMC to add to its existing inventory due to strong demand from Chinese companies, Reuters reported. But Nvidia was days later hit by allegations from China's cyberspace regulator and state media that the U.S. company's chips could pose security risks. 
Chinese authorities later cautioned Chinese tech firms about purchasing the H20, raising concerns about potential information security risks. Nvidia says its chips have no backdoor risks. 
Foxconn <2317.TW> has been asked by Nvidia to stop work related to the H20 chip, Reuters reported on Friday citing two people briefed on the matter. A third source said that Nvidia wanted to work through its existing H20 inventory first. 
Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Trade publication The Information reported on Thursday that Nvidia instructed Arizona-based Amkor Technology <AMKR.O> to stop production of its H20 chips this week and also notified South Korea's Samsung Electronics , citing two people with direct knowledge of the communications. 
Amkor handles advanced packaging for the chip, while Samsung Electronics supplies high-bandwidth memory chips for the model. 
Neither company immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment. 
Asked whether Nvidia had asked suppliers to halt production, Huang told reporters in Taipei that they had a significant number of H20 chips prepared and were now waiting for purchase orders from China customers. 
""When we receive the orders, we will be able to purchase more,"" he said. 
""We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions,"" Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement, adding, ""As both governments recognise, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure."" 
Huang said that shipping the H20 to China was not a national security concern and that the ability to ship the H20 chips to China was ""very much appreciated"".

Short term, ppl will over react, especially till earnings since Nvidia is in their quiet period (btw, this is the Information’s MO: releasing “shocking” Nvidia news during their quiet periods). 

Not concerned at all long term. Jensen already said this morning they are planning a new Blackwell-based chip for China. He will need to move fast on this…"
2025-08-22,"If this surprises anyone they aren't paying attention. The H20 chip is outdated. Why would China buy 10's of $Bs of them? Especially when Huawei is making more advanced ones in China. 

Getting H20 approved was a necessary step to then get more advanced chips approved. Call it a stepping stone. Yes, a frustrating one, but not a surprising one. 

And NVDA started the day down over $3 but has significantly improved. 

Now we just need Jerome not to F things up. But unlikely as almost anything he says will be bad news to someone."

2025-08-21,$40B in AI chip buys locked in is massive tailwind for NVDA — that’s basically guaranteed demand flow from EU. Add that to their moat in datacenter GPUs and it’s hard not to stay long-term bullish here. Only real risk is supply chain choke or export restrictions tightening.
2025-08-22,"The European Union says in the deal that Europe will purchase these things, but it doesn’t say exactly who. 

The European Union, any specific EU member, nor any specific EU companies are promising to purchasing anything. There’s a very big hole in the execution planning of this deal. It’s purely speculative.

It doesn’t sound like there’s enough in the deal to heavily affect investor sentiment until there’s more details. Investment strategies based on this deal are just a gamble."

2025-08-22,"Regardless of the numbers, keep in mind NVDA has a tendency to sell off after earnings announcements. With tech under pressure this month, after having gained over 50% in the fastest time since March 2020, the market is due for a rest and this adds risk to holding NVDA through earnings.

If you're already a long-term investor from lower prices, it's certainly a hold. But if you're looking to establish a new position or gamble that the reaction will be positive, you'd be taking significant risk."
2025-08-22,"Thank god I’m not a day trader with this stock. 
I’d loose my mind the way it goes up and down lately. Luckily I bought a long time ago at $ 28 for long term growth. Plan to yank my money out in a few years unless the political environment changes for the worst ( civil unrest at levels higher than they are now ) Then I’m taking my money out."

If it gets back to 150, I may buy more, but I'm already so heavy on NVDA, I'd probably look elsewhere anyway.

2025-08-22,Exactly - check out the analyst price estimates and consider whether Huang deserves a premium to whatever software they use.  He does.  Ask yourself if he is out of ideas.  He isn’t.  He saw the Palantir presentation no doubt. This will be better and I’m sure very important to him with all the BS coming out of the media trying to keep the price down. Not sure who is selling their stock right now but the float is too large to know true value without full information and volume. My largest holding and will remain so through close Wednesday. Powell decision from my perspective is irrelevant to whether I continue to own any of my stocks which is just 8.
2025-08-24,"Wouldn’t you lose if it’s too soon. I mean when you roll, you buy to close your covered call but that’s not to say it will be in the positive. If there’s a good amount of time, you’d be in the negative but if it’s 2 days till expire then yes I can see that happening."
2025-08-24,"Where else would u look? Wanna get to ur level of stocks, 850k sheeshhh. U reckon if theres a dip after earnings it’s worth buying?"
2025-08-22,"I make no assumptions in the stock market.

I have little doubt NVDA is going to beat estimates. The question is will they raise guidance? Will they take a cautious stance with the constant threat of 300% tariffs? Are there any potential delays with Rubin?

With META announcing an AI hiring freeze, there may be concern about a slowdown in AI spending. If NVDA guidance supports this thesis in any way, there can be a selloff.

Mostly, earnings reactions are about market mood. Currently, the market is in a bad mood. Will this change by next Thursday?

Bottom line, it's a big risk to hold any stock through earnings. My NVDA basis is in the 40's so I have no concerns, but anyone who buys a fresh position ahead of earnings just needs to accept the risk."
2025-08-22,"I don't see why you can't own both, and while I'm not sure AMD will blow up soon, people did say the same about AMD and Intel, 10 years ago if you said AMD would take all the top 10 best selling desktop CPUs on Amazon people would've thought you were insane

https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189

Intel recently took the 10th but now there's no other Intel  CPU within the top 15th. Intel still has a big market share in laptops through monopolizing deals with laptop OEMs, but as you can tell, the company is losing on the tech side and it's going down the IBM route of hardware irrelevance.

The real Nvidia edge is CUDA, this allows them to sell $25k GPUs because they're the only ones with CUDA able 80GB VRAM GPUs. mROC and Vulkan backends for LLMs have compatibility issues and a pain to setup, or give a perf penalty, respectively.

If mROC and ZLUDA get better, AND get traction with data centers, Nvidia's market share will take a hit, and will be forced to stop price gouging on their data center focused GPUs.

This is all provided AMD or someone else catches up before the GPU demand dries up, LLM hype is starting to be questioned, and it's unknown if the market will find a hyped up GPU hungry usecase afterwards."

2025-08-22,"You have not worked with China.  It is 100% noise.  They are using dumb remarks by US government officials, who frankly don’t know what they are talking about, to justify putting their own pressure on NVDA.  From their perspective they see NVDA cave to political pressure.  What they really want is access to the Blackwell chips.  Publicly they will say don’t buy H20 chips.  In reality they want them but they would prefer the Blackwell chips.  

The noise is because it’s just a political game.

Edit for caveat: what is not noise is that the CCP does not like the idea of the US government adopting state capitalism, that is their schtick."

2025-08-22,"Well, that is dump in a way that he say it out loud.   The same apply to military hardware but you don't see us telling allies that we are selling stuff a few generations behind.

2025-08-21,"By all means put limits on the chips that can be sold, but there is no need to come out and say haha we are selling you our rubbish.

Also in the same vein as your last thought, I think China could say 'If America wants to compete they can grow their own rare earth minerals.'"
2025-08-22,"Yeah that comment by Jensen is bogus though. Jensen wants to sell to China because it's good business for his company, aka $$$$. He doesn't care about geopolitics. But to say it accelerates China by not selling to them is obviously untrue. If the tech Nvidia makes is actually state of the art, then by definition China doesn't have that available if they can't buy from Nvidia. The idea that China is going to try harder now but would have been relaxed otherwise is silly."

Other areas that will complement AI is the higher processing/compute - which is the chips side (hardware end). 

So, it is not at all wrong to consider this is THE future. It may take a few setbacks and iterations - but it will only go in this direction. Look at autonomous driving, autonomous HR, caller assistant, etc."
2025-08-21,"The AI you are talking about is not the AI which is currently available. But the market valuation is already anticipating the AI you are talking about.

Best case at expiration: NVDA closes right around $182.5. Your longs gain value, your shorts are capped, and you don’t have naked risk.

If NVDA stays under $172.5, both expire worthless, and you’re out the premium.

If NVDA rockets way past $182.5. That’s where it gets risky because those 7 uncovered shorts can rack up unlimited losses.


If you want to simplify and sleep easier, you might

1. Close 7 of the short calls so it’s an even spread (70 vs. 70). That way, your risk is capped and defined.


2. Take profits early if NVDA rallies near $182.5 before expiration, instead of holding all the way through earnings.


So you do have a spread working for you, but the unbalanced contracts are the part to be careful about. Balancing it out will make the trade much safer."
2025-08-21,">Is my best case scenario that NVDA hits $182.5 sometime before September 19th, and I close the positions


When you are short 7 positions through a earnings event with your portfolio size, there is no best case scenario. You are playing with fire with a gasoline tank nearby. Either close the 7 short positions ASAP or open 7 long positions. "
2025-08-23,This is like a poor man’s covered call (short). I think I’ve seen a play like this before.
2025-08-20,Just own shares and stop gambling!!
2025-08-20,Keep going down and the  we can buy more haaha
2025-08-20,"We are all doomed, it is over. The CEO should walk down to the federal courthouse to declare bankruptcy already."
2025-08-20,"Lmao. It's a buy at 140, not now."
2025-08-20,Or you could have just bought when it was $80 and do trailing stop losses. Then you can just chill and not make stupid posts such as this
2025-08-20,Earnings miss coming up.
2025-08-20,Buying time 😎
2025-08-20,Buy buy buy

2025-08-20,Ive been holding 450 shares of arm as well.  that one i do feel doomed on. lol
2025-08-20,I thought about buying CoreWeave but I’d rather just buy more NVDA 🤷‍♂️
2025-08-20,Someone told me 160K per $NVDA chip in a Microscope; the bench is full of them....
2025-08-20,CRWV has tanked but so did NVDA at various points. I'm buying for the future and building a position.
2025-08-20,Won’t this affect earnings coming up then?
2025-08-21,"If NVDA was a paper handed, but good thing Jensen’s got diamond knuckles"
2025-08-20,"They haven't lost anything, because they didn't panic sell like degenerate clowns

They are investing in CoreWeave as the next generation AI cloud computing platform for the next 10+ years, not day trading meme coins"
2025-08-20,"No moat. From my understanding, all they do is GPUaaS. They buy Nvidia GPUs and then sell that compute power to customers. There is no moat or competitive advantage. Someone chime in if I’m misunderstanding"
2025-08-19,"I don't see any change in the short term.  Even if AI is proved fruitless in the current versions something else will materialize.  IF they do manage to achieve AGI ... NVDA will most likely go to the moon, IMO."
2025-08-19,"The idea that AI has plateaued is patently insane. That would be like saying cars have plateaued after they develop the model T in 1905… There’s a long friggin way to go. 

With the history of technology the way it is I can’t imagine who the moron is that thinks that"
2025-08-19,"In the past 25 years NVDA is one of, if not, the best stock with a **59,565% return**. AI has only really played a huge factor in the past 10 years. Source - AI"
2025-08-19,"They said the same thing about computers early on, said the same thing about Microsoft early on, said the same thing about cell phones early on, said the same thing about game consoles early on....

2025-08-19,"Few got rich out of gold rushes, but many got rich selling shovels. 

The inevitable burst came with certainty."
2025-08-19,nvda and tsmc strongly disagree with you and the bears
2025-08-19,"Capability progress has stalled but AI usage is growing. We just aren't going to lose our jobs in the next few years.


Bad news for OpenAI, but fine for NVIDIA."
2025-08-19,Check my post history about Nvidia valuations. AI is grossly overvalued in economic terms. Do with that information what you will.
2025-08-19,Nvda could actually obtain quantum and implement it before anyone. Because $$.
2025-08-20,"Ask yourself if you’ve found value using AI. Me personally it has changed my life dramatically. This alone is enough to tell me, one way or another, AI is going to shape our future and that’s really all you need to know. As for exactly what company to bet on it depends, but if you’re talking about AI or no AI, it’s without a doubt not going anywhere and will continue to grow."
2025-08-20,"The race to giants models is a bubble.
LLM are power tools, but people think that somehow, increasing there sizes will reduce their costs.

The current reality is that only few people will be willing to pay for the AI at its true price. Currently every company is racing to get market shares and when a company try to go toward profitability, performances decay, cost increases or we are seeing big limitations in number of available api calls.

My guess is the following: Ai bubble will explode because of its cost/efficiency trade off. Then, companies will learn to optimize their product, reinforce their backend and find new way to save do more with less. Less tokens, smaller models, but more efficient results, that people will be able to afford.

As a consequence we will see shovel providers (aka: nvidia) prices collapse as the need of massive computational power reduces. But AI and LLM will survive, like internet did."
2025-08-20,That’s fine. I will hold onto every Nvidia share until March 2035.
2025-08-21,"I stopped using contractors for things such as graphics. It saves me months of waiting. I get graphics in minutes. I don’t ask my lawyer stupid questions anymore. Or my CPA. If something is broken, ChatGPT walks me through fixing it. I actually just fixed an issue using AI that will save the food industry around $175M a year."
2025-08-21,"Anyone that thinks its plateaud or cares about the 95% non profit rate on businesses failing at creating their own generative applications are missing the entire picture that is inference and compute power that is relevant towards the successful ai applications.  Nobody cares about the 90% fail rate of startups.  ""Startups arent dead"" because they cant do better what someone else already has.   Ai has moved on from simply training and the economics of it now revolve around tokens compute capacity and using the existing relevant ai that exists."
2025-08-23,"I personally think to the everyday person AI isn’t at an autonomous personal assistant level that most people would like.

LLMs are cool but at the end of the day they’re just a tool. Since there isn’t huge profits being immediately returned people may back track cause they can’t get a quick high off making a ton of money.

For the people that know we’ve already had 2 era’s of AI rising and falling called AI winters, where the technology pretty much stopped progress up until around 2010 with Neural Networks being introduced.

AI WILL eventually change the world once the technology progresses further and people start figuring out more use cases other than what we’re doing now. It’s a really expansive frontier imo that we’re just starting to use in the general public domain.

I have a BS in CS and I’m looking to get an MSc in the subject. I think we haven’t even scratched the surface of the possibilities regarding the technology.

With all that being said people have expectations that may or may not be within the current scope of what’s possible which influences the talk of this “bubble” 

I’ll end with this, industrialization changed the word and imo AI is the second coming of that process on the digital landscape"
2025-08-20,"The big caveat there and it’s pretty huge.. is that in the dot com bubble people were investing in things like Microsoft because of the internet. Microsoft didn’t sell the internet and most homes (that then installed the internet) already had Microsoft installed anyway. Internet companies (or tele) had to spend tons of money to get the internet up and running and it took a long time to become profitable. 

With Nvda, your not actually investing in the equivalent of the internet because your not investing directly in an ai service. Your investing in the product that makes it possible - it is the equivalent of investing in  a company selling the lines, not just using them and it’s already profitable. 

I’m not saying a bubble is not possible because it certainly is, but it doesn’t share the same shortcomings."
2025-08-19,"I didn‘t say I think AI is a bubble. I didn’t say I think AI is overhyped. I said I have been hearing this from multiple other sources. And, if the bearish view on AI happens to be right, and I am wrong, what does that mean for NVDA stock?"
2025-08-20,Many tried to cast shadows over the shovel makers and sellers.  It just didn't have the sex appeal... But those who remained steadfast became rich beyond their wildest dreams
2025-08-19,"I am not a doomer on AI or NVDA. My question is that even if the bearish view on AI does happen to be correct, would or wouldn’t NVDA still be a valuable stock?"
2025-08-19,"I think even at this level, we need 1000x more compute. While general purpose LLMs may be near a peak, or at least a plateau, applying those models to specific industries will take time. Add in some more advanced agents (better documented API interactions), improve the speed, reduce cost, and enable double or triple checking, and we still have a ridiculously powerful technology. 

This does not even consider robots and new approaches to AI."
2025-08-19,"To some extent that is not zero, achieving AGI is already built into the price."
2025-08-19,"Quantum computing and traditional computing are not and are never going to be fighting between each other for which is better. 

When and if quantum computing becomes consumer grade, it will sit alongside traditional computers to perform a subset of tasks, much like a GPU does today, but it will not replace any part of the traditional computing hardware stack."
2025-08-19,"Unfortunately like all investing--- that's the unanswerable question.  No such thing as a crystal ball.  NVDIA will continue to be the center of the AI universe for at least 2-3 years, and not sure how this will relate to bear/bull market.  If anything we'll see some sharp profit taking followed by even sharper rebounds.

The biggest, hardest question for me is where is the peak.  Everything now is based purely on earnings potential which is driven by global demand and innovation.  The foundational technology exists, the ideology of AI has been wholly formed and put in place, now the building blocks will be strategized added, revised, improved upon and redefined 10 times over.  

Flashbacks of the tech craze-- things like memory, cpus, storage, etc.  These are all a part of this today but those bubbles have each independently leveled off.  Good example is INTEL.  They were the innovator ad nauseum that couldn't lose.  Their bubble burst dramatically because they over innovated, and threw away tons of $$ at little pet projects that would bare no significant fruit, all the while as the NVIDIA express left the station and ← them in the dust.  They lost their focus.  OK I'm rambling on, sorry for that."
2025-08-19,"I agree. Traditional Google searches are measured in milliseconds. Thinking LLMs take seconds or minutes to respond. The unit economics do not work for foundation models at that level of inefficiency, and user engagement scales with speed. 

So even with no continued gains in intelligence, there is still a strong incentive for foundation model providers to upgrade their data centers to more efficient inference architectures, like Blackwell and Rubin."
2025-08-19,Eventually the miners stop buying shovels?
2025-08-19,Yep. Then they go broke and sell their shovels for pennies. Just like the Chinese Bitcoin miners who sold their GPUs by weight in street markets a few years back.
2025-08-20,"I’m long 70 Nvda Sept 19 $172.5 calls, and short 77 Nvda Sept 19 $182.5 calls. Is my best case scenario that Nvda goes up to $182.5 prior to earnings, and I close both positions? Any help is greatly appreciated!"
2025-08-19,"Options are predicting a 7% - 8% move on earnings. If it goes up 8%, it almost reaches $200."
2025-08-19,If hits 160 will buy more
2025-08-18,"I won’t be surprised if we see a pullback before the end of the year, but I do think we end the year $200+"
2025-08-19,"If Nvidia pulls back $160 level (as mentioned in OPs video), that would be another generational opportunity similar to the one in April. I am balls deep in Nvidia , however at $160 I am going in full port."
2025-08-19,"Definitely getting a pull back after earnings call ( even if they blow earnings out of the water), it's been the trend of this quarter, you can never earn enough to appease the big players."
2025-08-19,Miss and lower guidance from earnings
2025-08-20,"Looking at the daily and weekly charts shows that NVDA hit the bottom of a sell zone 20% (\~$181-184) after exiting a flat base/consolidation pattern that started just north of $153. That $153 level was the high from the beginning of the year before the Trump Administration took over and started rattling the markets. 

Right now I see the stock sitting just below its 21 day moving average which usually acts as support for this stock, at least since late April. Since it closed below this line, I could easily see a further pullback (along with the rest of the tech sector) to maybe the $160-$165 area, or potentially even further down to that $153 level if the overall market also pulls back. 

Honestly, though, the next catalyst for the stock is going to be earnings in 8 more days. We'll get a lot more information from the company then for the rest of FY26 and the direction of the stock. 

Holding my 4300 shares for now, and potentially loading up more (shares and/or call options) near $160."
2025-08-19,Just got 182. We going to 242. If we fall to 160 buy. Trump backed this so it should go brrrr
2025-08-19,pullback imo first it's priced for perfection and with china still not a done deal market likely pull back with earnings before china deal is done
2025-08-19,So did you full port when it pulled back to $95 in April?
2025-08-19,"""generational opportunity"" is pushing it. $120 would be a generational opportunity imo"
2025-08-19,Unless of course there is a stellar earnings report with huge guidance. then we'll see.
2025-08-19,How is the China deal not done? Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay 20% of revenue as tariffs to the US government for an chips China buys.. so it's done
2025-08-19,"I didn’t have the cash on hand that I do now, however I did end up buying some around $130 price range, and also purchased from NVDL and NVDX. Those investments have definitely helped my port. I am also in some other stocks that I would definitely liquidate for NVIDIA if it goes down to $160, $140, $120. Luckily I did buy a bunch when it went down to $178 last week."
2025-08-19,"My point is, you missed it just a couple months ago, so you'll miss it again. It doesn't look like a generational opportunity at the time, only in hindsight. I was one of those people buying at $94 at the beginning of April when others were fearful of a global market collapse."
2025-08-18,Yes but not in a long time
2025-08-18,Prolly when it reaches $1000+ again
2025-08-19,Took a long time to recover from the last split
2025-08-22,"If it ever reaches $1000, no point in doing it right now lol"
2025-08-18,"2 years is a long time for tech stock, i’d say if you really believe in the company then it’s not a bad bet."
2025-08-18,Bad idea . Bet the delta is .3 or less?
2025-08-18,"If NVIDIA rises significantly in the next couple months, you might be able to sell it and profit."
2025-08-18,"Just to be clear, if you’re trying to get shares, then this will get assigned as long as the underlying is at or above the strike price. It doesn’t need to hit your break even point to get shares assigned to you. 

If you’re just trying to flip the calls themselves for profit that’s another matter. Leaps are typically easy money but you probably should have researched more on leap strategies before doing this"
2025-08-19,Its not bad. May be better timing later but I think you will have a very nice return
2025-08-19,"How much premium did you have to pay to get those calls? Last time I checked, they are expensive.
Year 2027 $300, premium or one contract is for $1840"
2025-08-19,"Not crazy, if you believe in the stock long term, holding makes sense. Adjust only if your outlook changes."
2025-08-19,"It doesn't have to go above 284. It can just go above its current price when you bought it for the option to appreciate in value, then sell it for any profit."
2025-08-21,Hope you make a lot of money on it. I’m long on Nvidia.
2025-08-22,I'm looking to buy similar on nvda. Screw a bull call spread. I'm thinking a 140 strike.
2025-08-19,Am I late? Can I still buy it?
2025-08-20,I have a $200 for January
2025-08-18,"it's gonna be a game of price is right for me. i'm gonna have to really keep up with the stock and see what happens. i could pull out early or i could wait, all depends on nvidia"
2025-08-19,"Always take profits 20% all day, and the cycle repeats. I do hold long term though. At the end of the day no profits are made until you sell the shares."
2025-08-18,"January 2024 I bought the “Nancy special” Pelosi had bought Dec 2024 NVDA calls,. Anyways, I went hard snd bought the goddamn same strike and all, $20k

That shit as you know kept climbing and I kept wondering if I should sell, it got to a point where I was actually concerned about capital gainz, so I let them expire and now I own an obscene amount of stock on margin. But my gainz meter has been tingling since and by gainz meter I mean my dick"
2025-08-18,"depends on the price. if nvidia ends at 400(lowest forecast prediction from yahoo finance) i'd make 460% profit. 
350: 260% profit
300: 61% profit 
and unlikely but 600: 1264% profit
and again i could pull out earlier and make more at a smaller price"
2025-08-19,lol no the option expires in 2 years and a couple months. your quite early if u do this but this is me believing in nvidia long term. do this on your own research
2025-08-18,So you have a 40% chance of winning. If earnings are bad it will hurt
2025-08-22,His breakeven is well below low estimates of nvda over the next 2 years. Even a mild bear case is his breakeven.
2025-08-18,Prolly the one holding up the US economy
2025-08-18,"I hold both, both doing very well"
2025-08-18,AMD has far more potential which is how I invest
2025-08-18,"The question isn't... NVDA vs. AMD.... IS NVDA currently over valued and due for a correction. 

Therefore not a good buy and better to wait for the correction"
2025-08-18,"There can be only one mentality is amusing. 

Long term investors = Nvidia 

Contrarians, betting on growth = AMD"
2025-08-18,"I think AMD is getting more respect from consumers due to increased focus on their drivers which were previously terrible. 

I consider that to be a leading indicator of future earnings."
2025-08-18,Buy both!
2025-08-18,"Probably make a quicker profit from amd buy Nvda better in any portfolio long term

Cheaper too - p / e

With so much more revenue and growth and 
Structure in the game. 

No brainer imo

But to be safe get both 
And don’t overlook 
MU or Marvell 
And especially 
Broadcom !!!!!!!"
2025-08-18,"If we look at P/S nvidia is about 3,5x higher indicating huge margins which can be at risk if AMD succeed to develop ROCm to break the CUDA software advantage. Once the CUDA advantage is breached they will trade much closer in terms of P/S, which is bullish for AMD. AMD have already closed the hardware deficit with their new MI355/MI350"
2025-08-18,The second most valued asset in the whole world says it all
2025-08-18,Little bit of both. I got in on AMD when it was around $95.
2025-08-18,"I buy both, admittedly a lot less AMD. I wish AMD would do better because I know they're a lot better than Nvidia in terms of supporting customers, I even have an all red computer, but damn Nvidias stock is just too good. I like AMD ethically and Nvidia to make money."
2025-08-19,I don’t like hardware long term. I’d say neither. I’m long on Google/amazon. Hardware will go to unit cost and commoditized. Then what?
2025-08-19,"Honestly, both AMD and Nvidia have their strengths, but I’m leaning more toward Nvidia right now. Their dominance in the AI and data center space is hard to ignore, plus their GPUs are still the gold standard for gaming. With all the focus on AI advancements and the killer performance of the RTX series, it feels like they’re just in a prime position to keep surging ahead. But at the end of the day, it all depends on what you’re looking for—if you’re all about gaming, Nvidia seems like the safer bet, while AMD might have some compelling options for certain budgets. Let’s see what earnings reports say next!"
2025-08-20,AMD has a better shade of green
2025-08-20,NVDA can (and does) actually turn a (hefty) profit.
2025-08-20,"Amd the peg is way better, if I had to buy one right now. 

I have both."
2025-08-20,nvda is the semi conductor space that isn't up for debate. Given this AMD doesn't have to overtake nvda. It just needs to be 2nd place and I believe it's in a perfect position to do so.
2025-08-20,AMD has a LOT more room for exponential growth like NVDA saw in 2024.    It's a well-run company that is probably the best positioned to breach NVidia's moat eventually.  I think it's well worth investing in.
2025-08-21,I would buy both. Nvidia is a beast.  AMD is very interesting from a growth perspective.  Both will make you a lot of money.
2025-08-21,"Roll the dice, it's anyone's guess long term."
2025-08-22,"And designs incredibly good products which is why I bought AMD back when they introduced ryzen CPUs which were the beginning of the downfall of Intel.  Both companies have an incredibly high risk business model since they essentially rely on tsmc for manufacturing.  If AMD ever designs a better product than Nvidia then their stock will skyrocket.  

Tbh just buy both imo.  One or the other will win and more than likely they will both win just one more than the other."
2025-08-18,"Both, own both, both is good."
2025-08-18,AMD's rally is just about up IMHO. NVDA for a long-term investment.
2025-08-19,"Similarly, there are semiconductor ETFs such as SMH."
2025-08-18,Thats like saying why not buy Intel as well. There are clear winners and losers.
2025-08-18,I don't know...AMD looks bullish in some ways on this chart.
2025-08-18,"In the semiconductor space, there has always been a 2nd, 3rd and 1000th place... AI just introduced a paradigm shift due to Nvidia's preparedness, but other players will eventually catchup and things will level up again."
2025-08-18,that is why you always buy at the top 😂
2025-08-18,"I feel like if you can argue that AMD would worsen your portfolio, you can make that same argument with every other company.  Thus, my statement of unless you're all in on one stock (Nvidia).  Personally, I bought quite a bit of AMD and Nvidia a few months ago (~$80 and $95 respectively).  Both have returned life changing money for me but the AMD investment is still 40-50% more.  I just don't get why people would be afraid to own both."
2025-08-19,The existence of this term doesn’t mean all diversification is bad.
2025-08-19,"Well its not binary as in there is one winner and one loser. Multiple will share the market, nvda could and will lose part of the market. Theyre realistically not staying at 83% market share for the next 5 years. 

Its alright to pick 2-3 ai companies contrary to the belief of redditors. You could want to capture the growth of the smc sector, focusing on stocks that have higher risk/growth potential, knowing that nvda growth has already happened. Thats a form of diversification within a sector."
2025-08-18,"I mean, that's probably not a bad idea with the recent government funding.  But I'm just considering ai accelerators and future price movement.  I stayed in a previous comment that I added sizeable amounts to my AMD and Nvidia positions in April at 80 and 95, respectively, and AMD has so far been a better return.  There definitely are clear winners and losers but we don't know who they are yet.  Nvidia being the largest company in the world and winning in the past doesn't really tell me that I'll get better returns moving forward.  And there's nothing that tells me that AMD is anything remotely like Intel."
2025-08-18,Then buy TSMC
2025-08-18,That is why I bought 3 years ago and I'm 900% up on that buy.
2025-08-18,It just comes down to if you think one is a better investment than the other (less risk and/or higher return potential) there's no reason to invest in both. If you think one will have better returns you are leaving money on the table by investing in both when you have the opportunity cost of investing in the better one.
2025-08-20,Same. Bought AMD when the stock was way undervalued and has given great returns
2025-08-19,"ohhh, you got the 95$ dip for nvidia. I didn't manage to catch the bottom of that specific one. Sorta regret shooting my shot when it sorta stabilized at 124. It's still fine, but not as great."
2025-08-19,Correct but it might explain why you would hold NVDA and not AMD
2025-08-22,"i buy NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Arm, and Qualcomm.  Equal parts.  Each pay period.  What say you?"
2025-08-18,I'm buying all lol
2025-08-18,"Yeah that makes sense.  From my perspective, I don't know which will be the better investment over 10 years.  I believe that by owning both, i'm doing a very mini niche hedge of ai chips.  Thus, I'm decreasing my risk of lost gains or losses if either one does drastically better.  While it's obvious what Nvidia is and makes, it worries me just how big the company is in comparison.  There's a lot of factors for growth that I just cannot predict.  Now I'm guaranteed to win in some way or the other.  Plus, if only one wins, I'll still be able to retire well into my 30s all things considered."
2025-08-20,"I think it's psychology.  At this point, NVDA investors are tribal in the way Apple users are."
2025-08-21,bought 200 shares around $88.. feelin good
2025-08-18,"Yes definitely, we don't know the future. That's why investments are risky. Indeed you are reducing your risk by investing in both, and simultaneously, you are reducing your potential gain. It's possible AMD drastically outperforms NVidia going forward in which case the best returns would have come from going all in on AMD."
2025-08-18,Brother do you ever get tired of posting goofy shit like this every day?
2025-08-18,I say we end green every day until the end of time. All tomorrow's parties.
2025-08-18,Posts like these is how you know it’s gonna go red again
2025-08-18,See you at $185

2025-08-17,"Not much older than you, and started a few months ago. If I’ve learned anything so far is don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Put most of it in a SP500 or all world index, and if you also want to invest in individual stocks I’d suggest putting 5/10% into safe bets like google, Microsoft or BRK . Over the long run they won’t let you down. Nvidia is no doubt a good company but not good enough to throw 100% of your savings into imo"
2025-08-17,DO STOCK AND SHARES ISA
2025-08-19,I have been substantially rewarded since I began my long-term investment in Nvidia.  Just keep investing in this stock and ignore the volatility from time to time.  It would not have become the largest company of the world by market capitalization if it isn’t an innovative company that adapts well in a rapidly changing technological field.
2025-08-18,"You're probably the next Bill Gates 

Good job for starting buddy"
2025-08-17,Pls don't jsut invest in nvidia if you're beginning your investment journey. Especially given that the AI bubble/insane overvaluations bubble may pop soon. I'd stick it in an index if I were you.
2025-08-17,"good luck, i am 33 from essex and 9 months in to my investing 'career' lol, also on t212"
2025-08-17,You’ve literally started investing before this all comes down next year. Save the cash and buy big at bottoms of 2026/into 2027
2025-08-17,Read the psychology of money and the little book of common sense investing. Blue chip companies are an ok to invest in but I would use a small percentage investment amounts for that like 10%. Funds like sp500 or total us market and let grow for the next 30 years will do you good too.
2025-08-18,"I put 10k in nvidia a couple years ago (and 10k in microsoft) because I had filled up one the government-allowed savings account. The nvidia went about x6 since then. And I've put more gradually.

I don't expect it to go that high up ever again, but if it can double every 5 years, it'll be good."
2025-08-19,You’re a smart investor.  You’ll do well.
2025-08-17,"crazy how u bought nvda at its all time high and made it 100% of your portfolio. i only see this going one way, the stock crashes u panic sell and vow to never invest again. ffs think and research what stock markets are before investing. if u wanna just dump money like this on trading 212 without without understanding anything go buy VWRP, its a vanguard global index fund, that includes nvda as well and should cover u"
2025-08-17,Nothing is a sure bet in life your advice is good.
2025-08-18,"I have a cash ISA with 20k in the trading 212 account, so my 20k is maxed out for the year I think.

Whats a stocks and shares ISA???"
2025-08-19,"Cheers mate.

I own:

Nvidia
Vanguard snp 500
Nebius NV.

Ill stick with these and buy every so often for the long haul."
2025-08-17,"dude stop giving shit advice about leveraged funds to someone starting out , that too just before nvda earnings and when it’s at its all time high"
2025-08-18,Im not selling a thing. Not until 2040.
2025-08-17,"Read this: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/what-is-an-index-fund#:~:text=An%20index%20fund%20is%20a,re%20also%20relatively%20lower%20maintenance.

If you don't know what an index fund is, you shouldn't be investing in individual stocks"
2025-08-17,It’s crazy that people don’t know . I feel bad for people who have been investing their whole life in a normal invest account
2025-08-18,It’s the exact same as what your doing now but an isa so all of your investments would be tax free . Yeah your idea would be maxed if you have a cash isa . Personally for me I don’t use them I have my stocks and shares ISA and a lifetime isa and a normal high Interest savings account for a car fund / emergency savings . What do you use your cash Isa for ?
2025-08-17,S&P safest investment
2025-08-17,"It's a 3x leverage nvidia. I would check its liquidity and age before piling in. A 10% gain would be 30%, but it also amplifies losses. You could end up in a situation where nvidia is dropping and you can't sell your shares because there are no buyers. Bmnr would probably be a better choice if you want more upside without the leverage factor. I would wait a week or so to get in, though. They just did an offering to raise capital for more ethereum."
2025-08-18,"thats what everyone says when they make bad decisions like this , when u start losing money you’ll panic and try to save what u have left and end up selling."
2025-08-17,"Any of these Index funds you recommend?

My plan was to go heavy into the AI/Tech companies. Id like to own stock in 5-6 companies and just buy theae stocks over a 10-20 year period. Thats why I started with Nvidia. Next would be Tesla etc."
2025-08-17,"some people just listen to people and hear that they should invest so they put money without doing any research . i told op in another comment, if he wanted to just dump money to buy vwrp and be covered , if he wanted to buy nvda not to make it 100% his portfolio especially at its current prices. its just gonna go bad and he’s gonna be discouraged to ever invest again"
2025-08-17,Saying that the S&P ist the safest Investment is the most dumbest thing ive ever heard
2025-08-17,"Not Tesla…Microsoft would be a better long term gainer, also Meta, even at today’s prices. However, the better idea is to wait for a market correction to pick up more shares for the same money. Entry points are important!"
2025-08-19,"If you start investing in Nvidia regularly, you’ll retire comfortably in London."
2025-08-17,"Yeah I’m glad I did research before investing , I’m 19 and invest in 100% VUAG now after selling my individual stocks . Other wise I would of had to pay a lot on tax when I got older"
2025-08-18,Personally I would invest most of that but obviously it’s up to you
2025-08-17,"Can you tell me which is safer?
Only gold might be considered safer but with less returns."
2025-08-17,"It means that it follows nvidias price movement x 3. So if nvidia gos up 1%, it goes up 3% and vice versa. But if nvidia drops 20% on earnings, you will lose 60% of the investment. Leveraged etfs are good for short-term price movement. They are awesome in a bull market. But a correction or bear market will drain them quickly."
2025-08-17,You’re better off starting with an index fund - probably one centred around the Nasdaq Composite if you’re keen on being in tech/IT/AI exposure. This will track the performance of the big tech companies and is likely a safer investment for you than just all in on 1-6 companies.
2025-08-18,I’m not sure because i don’t know how long your going to be investing for and what are your goals but for me i am 100% in an s&p500 fund as i am investing for long term (30+ years ) where’s as you might not be investing for that long . But if you are I would recommend putting most of it in an all world fund and maybe keeping the rest for anything else that comes up just in case
2025-08-17,Duh. The question is has it already been priced in. Which I think is unlikely personally
2025-08-17,I thought I saw somewhere that China is discouraging its companies from using nvidia chips. So easing of chip sales doesn't seem like it will be much of a factor. 🤷🏼‍♂️
2025-08-18,I expect the stock price going down until after few weeks of earnings even if its a strong quarter. Happens all the time with NV stock
2025-08-17,"So he speaks for nvidia?

Not that it matters because its probably right. If a country as powerful as China wants something bad enough they will find a way to get it"
2025-08-17,I buy a little everyday
2025-08-17,"Every week, I buy."
2025-08-17,"Isn't Trump coming out next week with more chip tarrif news? I'm going to wait and see if we dip again. If we do, it's buying time. Sam Altman said they don't have enough chips for higher level GPT 5 even now and data center production is projected to be huge for years to come. Bring me my dip plz."
2025-08-17,Everything good goes up eventually.
2025-08-16,"No, I'm comfortable waiting until the market cools off a bit. It's incredibly frothy and everything is at nosebleed valuations all over again. Nvidia in particular has a 'priced for perfection' issue it couldn't shake off in the second half of last year. I believe the situation will repeat itself again this time."
2025-08-17,Bought 3500 shares yesterday
2025-08-17,Nvda is a MUST and should only be bought when possible. It’s 100% a hold w/dividends rolled over rather then a sold w/capital gains to come :)
2025-08-17,I looking doing average cost buying with automatic investing. I’m looking for a pull back before making a larger purchase.
2025-08-20,"If you buy VOO or any other S&P ETF like many do, you're buying Nvidia all the time and not a small amount of the fund either. It's at least 4-9%."
2025-08-17,150 then I’ll buy it
2025-08-17,"$145 puts, it is going down 👇

Big Boys starting to sell"
2025-08-17,Buying FET… it’s going to rip hard in a month.
2025-08-17,Just curious why people do weekly buys rather than accumulating cash and waiting for the inevitable dip. I see the point of DCA when a stock is headed down. I don't really see the point of buying at ATH when price action is fairly volatile and you know with virtual certainty that it will soon be available cheaper. My CB is \~100. I just couldn't bring myself to pay 180.
2025-08-17,Tell me you sell 3 covered calls every week and capture a premium
2025-08-17,Big boys have been selling for a while now in the 179-184 range. They’ll not buy back until a proper pullback.
2025-08-17,"The inevitable dip may never come.  Even if it does, it may be well past the price point it’s sitting at now.  This in fact…may be the dip."
2025-08-17,How high above current price do you do this? I would be pretty scared of getting in the money especially on nvda
2025-08-17,"Depends on the stock, but for this one, I’d be comfortable with doing like 195-200 strike price. If it gets close, just roll up and out. Can’t see it taking off again. I think it either continues on this correction down, or just a slow burn up. That’s just my thought process. Again this is for weekly, not anymore. If I was to do a month or more, I’d pick a strike of like 220 to be safe."
2025-08-21,And its coming down . That didn't take long
2025-08-18,"Alright I’ll rephrase it for u. I PERSONALLY think NVDA will go higher but not before it gets choppy for a little bit. They dominate the AI space, they have tons of cash on hand. Jensen is constantly investing in companies generating extra cash flow. They’re now investing in PSIQuantum, a quantum startup. This sector will probably be the next wave of tech."

2025-08-16,"Yeah this is priced in already, this happened earlier in the week. It seemed like the stock did not care about Europe sueing them (that's all that ever seems to come out of Europe now days anyway) .

My friends in Romanaia like to joke that "" America will make something new, China will find a way to copy it and make it cheaper, Europe will find a way to make up new rules about the thing that nobody will follow anyway""."
2025-08-17,"Suing for patent infringements is nothing new. There are even companies (patent trolls) that buy countless patents for the intent purpose of suing other companies.

Some examples include: Intellectual Ventures, Vringo, VirnetX & Soverain Software.

Fun fact; they are all from the U.S."
2025-08-16,Buying huge Nvidia calls right after Trump announces up to 300% tariffs on semiconductor chips. What could go wrong?
2025-08-15,Nvda doesn’t need a pump. It’s a long term hold 10+ years
2025-08-15,$200 by the end of the year if we are lucky. $210 is possible in early to mid-2026. Your calls are cooked 😔
2025-08-16,"Reading the nonsense of the unknowing in these Nvidia threads is both entertaining and head shaking at the same time! So many of you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about and what's behind Nvidia nor the slightest clue about the depth of the company itself.

Nvidia is not a stock that you trade it's a stock that you buy and hold! AI is still in its infancy and Nvidia will be the dominant leader for a long long time! Whether you have a little or a lot of money to buy shares of Nvidia now, buying any amount that you can afford to park for the next 2 to 3 years will reward you tremendously.

Next step is to train yourself to ignore all of the Nonsense trash talk In these threads or by Market manipulating analysts and fear mongers. Those that failed to load their vaults with Nvidia now will soon be well known as complete NVIDIOTS!

Nvidia has minted more millionaires than almost any stock in history, and to think that it's going to stop anytime soon is totally foolish!"
2025-08-16,"Who knows. If NVDA up their guidance, it'll be over 200 easy. Personal I buy leap calls expiring in 2027. Much safer."
2025-08-15,Volume has been absolutely trash so far today. This is the price action we usually see on Friday afternoons... not an hour after open.
2025-08-15,So happy I sell calls 🤙 😂
2025-08-15,"I sure hope so
I’m down $4K"
2025-08-16,I bought $182 calls expiring next Friday. Easy money with Nvidia 💰 not gambling with the king of chips!
2025-08-16,Do people realize that the stock has more than doubled in less than 5 months?  Selling cc’s is like shooting fish in a basket.
2025-08-16,Better pray for the earnings pump.
2025-08-16,I don’t think so.  Today is not a good day for nvidia
2025-08-16,Once taco stops talking about tariffs on semiconductor chips
2025-08-16,Tell me like I'm 5. If you're buying an option I thought each contract is 100 shares. Why is your cost only $85 for one contract? Wouldn't your investment be 100 x $185?
2025-08-16,****laughing in DCA Index fund investor***

2025-08-16,"Yea, earnings coming up."
2025-08-16,Earnings!
2025-08-17,Nvda is doing chips and there will be big tech doing chips so don't expect this 4T market cap to hold for ever
2025-08-17,"It's only one of his many outrageous announcement. The market reacted with - 0,4% (nasdaq tech index), AMD- 1,8%, NVDA-0,8%. It's less that some casual red day in that industry. On the other hand, he allowed the sell of h200 to China which probably unlocks a bigger sell growth than the new government tax (tariffs) and its ""15% profit"" interception (racket) on AMD and NVDA foreign sales.. 

In my opinion, the latter announcement is more worrisome as it create an interventionism climate (opposed to liberal capitalism) where the government now negociate arbitrary deals with specific companies. Just like China did with his EVs and Ship industries."
2025-08-18,Get your 20$ options out of here
2025-08-19,Absolutely. Buy when others are fearful (selling due to tarrifs). Warren would be proud.
2025-08-19,"Idk... I'm bullish in general on NVDA, but it has a historical pattern of big, hard consolidations following blue sky runs. Then it tends to range a bit below the NATH before heading back up for more. The 9/5 position is likely deep fried. The 9/19 might have a shot if the stars align perfectly. I wouldn't make either bet, but good luck!"
2025-09-08,"So, U still holding those 9/19 calls?"
2025-08-16,Sigh if you’re going to even attempt options just buy ITM and give yourself at least 6 months. Otherwise just buy stock
2025-08-16,"Not saying this is the way to go.  Just saying this is what I have done.  Nvidia = just over 10% of my investment account as far as what I'm in for.  But accounts for nearly 37% of my total investment account because buy and HOLD long term.  I will continue to buy shares even if it's just 10 or 20 at a time as it makes sense to me.  I have 2 Roth accounts, 1 from a previous job that I rolled over into a Roth and yes paid the taxes.  The other in a Roth we have contributed to for years.  I'd  love to tell you I've made all the right moves over the last few years but that would be BS.  Ive never lost money but I've definitely left money on the table by not moving fast enough or moving to fast.  With 1 I try and buy when we get a good dip and then hold until it makes sense to sell and rinse and repeat.  That one is up over 200% since  i started doing this.  The other i straight up swing trade.  I don't really care the price point it's just is it low and about to come back up then buy when it goes back up and slips a little then sell.  Sometimes I sell to soon and it turns around quick some times I buy back in to soon and it goes down more.  Oh well that's trading and trying to time the market.  That one I'm up considerably beyond 200% since I started doing it.  There's no reason you cant have multiple strategies for this stock it's a winning bet."
2025-08-16,Guys let’s use our brains. It took Nvidia 20+ years to get to 4 Trillion market cap. Are you saying by September Nvidia can reach a 8 trillion market cap at at $500 price target?
2025-08-16,(I’ve been holding these for a hot minute)
2025-08-16,WAIT I DIDNT SEE THE NEWS
2025-08-16,"Long term is subjective. Folk who are already holding more than 10 years, what? You want them to hold another 10 years? Lol"
2025-08-16,"That’s what I really believed would happen last year. Regardless, still holding my bags @ 114ish. I own way too much for my portfolio. It’s like 23% of my total portfolio even after selling a few $130ish. Glad i only sold a few."
2025-08-17,HOLD THE LINE
2025-08-16,Imma sell the $210 call for $150 hopefully in the pre earnings run

2025-08-16,"I have 20% of my portfolio in nvidia, not a bunch just 127 shares but I will hold them and only add to them if the dip is 15% drop or more but it a long term accumulate and hold for me"
2025-09-08,"Oh Ok. NVDA was up well over 100% since its $86.61 low back in April. But NVDA made a bearish double top in August, and folks have been taking profits and cashing out, and dumping the stock since their earnings call..."
2025-08-16,Me and my 127.3 Nvidia shares over here trying not to cry 🥺
2025-08-16,“not a bunch just 127 shares” ok Mr Warren Buffett
2025-08-16,"If you’re not mocking me, we are in a great position.  As for myself, my average is low so a dip would have to be well over $100 for me to begin worrying.  Then again, I still wouldn’t worry, would just end up with 137 or more if I could afford it but a correction of 20-30% would definitely a spot to pick up more shares"
2025-08-16,Lol.  I started in 2021 before the 1:4 split.  Continued through the 1:10 split.  So most of my shares are because of those splits.
2025-08-16,"300% but 99% are exempted or reduced.

He just want a big number to look strong and manly."
2025-08-16,Nvda and tsmc exempt …. Literally bullish
2025-08-16,Should have kept my $160 9/19 calls.
2025-08-16,"Hell yeah, shorts on nvidia inbound!!"
2025-08-16,"Orange man is an intel share holder now, so no?"
2025-08-16,Doesn't the exemption only go so far as allowing them to sell to China for 15% of Chinese revenues? Or was there another exemption? I'm losing track.
2025-08-16,So long as they tow the line and  bow down to dictator Donnie
2025-08-16,"Could be worse. You could be holding soxl calls. I'm glad that I sold mine the other day. I should have sold my nvidia before today, though. But I am glad that I got out before the big drop."
2025-08-15,"My biggest regret selling 100k worth of pltr at $40. Shit is 180$ now. Would’ve been a 4 bagger.  Not going to $40 again anytime soon. 

Nvda never going down to 9$ anytime soon for you. Just hold."
2025-08-15,Fuck that. Hold it all if you’re no where near 50-60. Def will double again in 5-10 years.
2025-08-15,"Never sell Nvidia, I’ve owned it for ten years! Earnings coming out in less than two weeks. $200 in 2025!🚀"
2025-08-15,only sell if you see a stock that you think promises more profit
2025-08-15,Why sell now after all these years?
2025-08-15,We similar in ways. Personally I would trim a little. But I don't like to sell too much of my winners. I always regret it. I sold Tesla in 2021 after doubling in 1 year seemed too good to be true....
2025-08-17,"I'm still holding assets which are up 26,000%. You need to ask yourself if you would buy it today or not. If no, sell. If yes, hold."
2025-08-16,You are in a great position. My target is 300 within the next 2 years
2025-08-16,"If you sell some shares, what are you going to do with the money? If you can double the money go for it. If not, why sells?"
2025-08-16,"Why not just slowly sell a little bit at a time.

Sell 5 k a month. If it keeps going up - you’ll never notice."
2025-08-16,"Hold baby. The thing that separates a good investor and a bad investor is patience. 

When it dips, buy more. I’ve got about 2000 now doing that.. average price of 92"
2025-08-18,If only I bought Nvidia since 2016 instead of buying damn GPU’s. Fuck me
2025-08-16,"Honestly, I’d trim 50-150 shares here. Hold the rest."
2025-08-16,I would hold. Or just sell your cost basis worth and invest in something else. Keep the rest in NVIDIA as its pure profit. That gives you ~$5000+ to try to find another money maker.

2025-08-16,Sell 30%
2025-08-16,"Sell half.  You haven’t made money until you sell.  Keep some in if you like risk, but I’d be moving some out 🤷‍♂️"

2025-08-17,Yes of course!  Such a genius decision buying NVDA when you did.  Well done!  Hold forever.
2025-08-17,Yes but don’t get discouraged when it tanks next week when Trump issues tariffs on semiconductors
2025-08-17,Hold. are aware that stuff could posible double in 2 year. I have some positions that i bought in 2024 and already double it only took 1 year and 4 months.
2025-08-18,Hold for 10 years and retire
2025-08-18,I would sell a small percentage at some regular interval just to protect you from being so exposed in a single position. Can be really small like 1% or 2% every year.

# Irrational Exuberance 2.0 - NVIDIA’s Fundamentals vs AI Hype

As of mid-2025, NVIDIA’s market cap has hit an astronomical $4 trillion. But what’s even more staggering than that is NVIDIA’s current market cap makes the company more valuable than the GDP of **all but five G20 countries**: the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and India.

To put it in perspective:

* **NVIDIA is more valuable than the UK, France, Canada, Russia, Brazil, Italy, South Korea, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Argentina, and South Africa.**
* But if you exclude the EU as a bloc, and count only individual countries, NVIDIA is currently **more valuable than 90%** of the G20 nations.

And just to add another Bizzarro stat, NVIDIA is a company with fewer than 40,000 employees, but it now commands a market value that’s more than the entire national economies of multiple countries with hundreds of millions of citizens.

Back in 1996, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that markets were displaying “Irrational Exuberance”, and he stated that they might be inflating asset prices beyond what fundamentals justified, driven by over optimism around the internet and tech. Fast forward to 2025, and NVIDIA’s $4 trillion market cap is being fueled by similarly euphoric projections - this time around its AI, instead of the World Wide Web.

Today, strategists like Peter Oppenheimer at Goldman Sachs say stocks are “priced for perfection”, and warn that valuations are in the 93rd percentile of historical extremes. NVIDIA’s revenue and earnings growth are undeniably strong, but the odds of any company growing revenue at 100% annually indefinitely are effectively zero – its not just improbable, but its also mathematically and economically unsustainable. Even NVIDIA bulls should be able to see the handwriting on the wall. The law of large numbers looms large, and this will ultimately doom any company with such an astronomical valuation. When a single-day market cap drop exceeds the entire value of Disney or McDonald’s, you’re definitely in rarefied air. Based on its current valuation, in about 15 years NVIDIA’s market cap would surpass the GDP of the entire planet. That’s not just unlikely—it’s physically impossible.

2025-08-16,"Everyone has a similar story like that,  I dumped shares of Microsoft @ $43 years ago, imagine how much $$$$$ I would have today,  if I didn't sell! 

I also sold NVDA @ $165, who knew it would shoot back up past $180?

What if's are frustrating!"

2025-08-17,I did purchase at other prices and have another holding in a different account. 9$ is the average cost of this holding now
2025-08-17,"I bought NVDA simply because of gaming in computers, they were the best at the time. The fact AI came when it did and NVDA was investing in it is luck on my end."

2025-08-16,"Nvda going to 20t

Sell a few then"
2025-08-17,"sold at 177..

then it moved up to 180 thanks to donald trump saying nvidia is tariff free. i had to buy back in at 180"
2025-08-16,"On another note, there's nothing wrong in booking the profits and diversifying of it is at 50% of your portfolio. Sell in small quantities.
I had about 120 shares with avge cost of 55. I've booked a little at 175-185 range. Still have about 105 or so.

Since you've 650+, you can afford to bring it slowly down to 500 or so. Just my perspective."
2025-08-16,"Hold man, just imagine another 10-15 years…just imagine AI…"
2025-08-15,We bought 11 shares at 102 & 106 already made 800 dollars that’s still pretty crazy
2025-08-15,"Yes I'm very bullish. I'm holding my 2000 shares and 9 leap calls. There is no way NVDA misses ER during this AI spending spree from mega companies. Guidance will go off the roof as well. Jensen is brilliant. He knows how to lead and more importantly, he knows how to keep the stock price pumping"
2025-08-15,"I'm not sure the actual numbers matter all that much, unless they are a total blowout. It will be more about the mood of the market at the time. If NVDA doesn't significantly beat and raise, there is high risk of a selloff given how far this stock has come in a very short time without any pullbacks.

With AMAT reaction, and ASML a few weeks ago, the market may be anticipating a cooldown in semiconductor market. The manufacturing equipment makers are usually the first dominos to fall.

I personally will not be trading earnings, just holding my core position. I'll be happy either way. If we do get a selloff I'll be watching the 50-day average (currently 162.73 but will be higher on earnings day) and the prior all-time high (intraday 153.13, closing 147.63) as potential support areas to add to my position."
2025-08-15,They always meet/beat earnings and the stock always goes down and trades sideways before the next run up to earnings
2025-08-15,I’m holding 5 years and will reassess than since I will be at retirement age.
2025-08-15,With the whole world watching. I’d say it’s going to pop then sell. Then slowly retrace what it had and grind to new heights
2025-08-15,"If people are bullish, be bullish. It when they think the stock could go to infinity (some people saying 10T market cap) is when you should start saying “hmm, how far could this go?” Fundamentally, this company IS the future of AI. What they have is required for AI and in business nowadays, if you don’t adapt to AI you’re done. However, it has reached new heights. Though back in the day when everyone was saying that APPL was overvalued, it had tripled over time. So who the hell knows. 

TLDR: the market goes up, and the market goes down"
2025-08-15,"Probably priced in they're going to make it.


Unexpectedly high will surge the share price.


If on target might see a drop as traders get pessimistic and switch."
2025-08-15,"In my opinion, the price will move in a sideways trend until the financial results are released. I see two scenarios: the first, the results will be very good and the forecasts will also be OK, but there will be some news that won't cause the shares to explode. They will reach around $200 and we will see a correction. Then I intend to buy. The second scenario: the shares will move in a sideways trend until the results are released. The results will probably be very good in both scenarios, but the forecasts for the future may be mixed. A delay in the rubin, some bad news from China, will cause the shares to fall after the results and also mean. I intend to buy in this case probably lower than in the first one, around $135-150."

2025-08-15,"I am bullish, but i expect a pullback before earnings. Im considering selling and keeping as cash sum to buy back cheaper."
2025-08-15,"Priced in.

Stock will be sideways or down on great earnings (as always)"
2025-08-16,"If 🌮 can STFU about these tariff numbers that he pulls out of his ass that would be great. He already got his 15% cut and said that NVDA and AMD are exempt so I am hoping the sentiment remains bullish. This is a long term hold, however this continuous talk about tariffs doesn’t help. I am expecting a pullback around revenue time this year, even though I loaded more today when it dipped."

2025-08-16,What leaps are you holding ?
2025-08-19,"Yes because the amount of nvidias beat has slowed down 3-4 quarters ago. Nvidia is a victim of its own success.  This will be another sell on the news unless an accelerated beat restarts again.

I read somewhere earlier today that eps has to reach at least 48b/1.06  vs the consensus of 45.8/1.00 to move the price up."
2025-08-15,"I’m holding for ten years and my retirement.  I really, REALLY hope it goes back to being a four bagger by then.  I get the logical reasoning for why that is unlikely but hope springs eternal!"
2025-08-15,You have no idea what you are talking about but please keep selling.
2025-08-16,yea i bought 70 shares and sold them 2 days ago i rebought today when it got to 178 then i put the rest of the profits in voo amd and google
2025-08-15,Well I was going to hold for the next 15 years but you convinced me.
2025-08-16,Think of LLMs as a primitive component to a bigger AI system where each handles a smaller and simpler task. To get better and better more compute is needed but at inference as opposed to training sessions. It’s already proving valuable and penetration is incredibly low. As an ML engineer I’m super bullish about AIs run over the next 10-20 years and beyond.
2025-08-15,I mean that’s the whole point of social media. Bro this must be your first time picking up a phone. I know when you get to that age it can be scary. But that’s the point of social media.

2025-08-15,Hard to pick between NVDA and META at these prices. Probably better off waiting 2 weeks and then read this again.
2025-08-15,"Don't think about it. Just do it. If you are too nervous to put all that money, I would say put $1k, then DCA bi-weekly.

Another option is dump it all into VOO."
2025-08-15,"I’d spread $1,250 across each company, but if I had to go all-in on just one, it’d be a tough call between Nvidia and Meta."
2025-08-15,Don’t buy now. Wait for the dip
2025-08-15,"I would put $1k in each of your 4, and $1k in Alphabet. FAANG really starting to write own stories so isn’t just like those are the same picks. Look at each’s price movements carefully like the past 1-3 years so you know where you are boarding and what kind of tolerance you need when they dip on macro."
2025-08-15,"I bet 55% of my money in NVDA. However, if you want to buy now, Meta is better deal. It have much lower PE ratio. Only Google has lower PE than Meta in the 7. Meta is a crazy cash machine. Also I suggest buying leap calls instead of share. Choose far expiration date in 2027."
2025-08-16,"Dollar cost average into whatever stock you choose rather than dump all your 5k in at once.

If it goes down, youre happy and you can buy. If it goes up you’re happy because you bought. 

If you lump sum you have a higher chance of being disappointed at first, even if it eventually does go up."
2025-08-15,"You’re asking people on Reddit if you should invest 5k in Nvidia.  That alone is crazy.  If you were going to take on the risk, what would be your reasons?"
2025-08-15,I can’t roll it over until end of next June but my old slow 401k is getting all $50k rolled into Nvidia. 💪
2025-08-15,"Great question dude 

I say get 1 of each whatever that prices out to 

Rest into VOO

Enjoy 😊"
2025-08-15,When I’m feeling the fomo I buy 2 shares or go half intended amount and buy a couple cheap lottery ticket puts or a pit spread to put on it my mind at ease. So I don’t panic sell at the bottom again. Thank me later
2025-08-15,"Bought 45 shares of NVIDIA about 2 weeks ago after monitoring pretty much for 2 months before that. I still haven’t been on green as the FX rates changed since I bought, so I’ve been on a loss constantly. I think in the long term should be OK."
2025-08-16,S&P500 ETFs are pretty overweight on MAG7. So every time everyone puts $ in their 401k they're buying 7% of Nvidia etc.. This happens everyday for everyone all the time.
2025-08-16,"You're safer to put it into a fortune 500 etf. Nvidia is weighted the most, but you don't have to worry about what price level you got into Nvidia at"
2025-08-16,Def META over NVDA in those price levels
2025-08-18,"Im in the middle of contemplating this exact same decision; Meta or Nvidia. I currently own both, but I’m looking to go add a huge amount to one. From what I’ve gathered, META is the smarter investment, especially since it’s a real possibility that they may have a stock split in the near future."
2025-08-18,Buy xeqt like 80 percent after that nvidia if u want to play around.
2025-08-20,"Yes. Nvda is a premier company who believes in itself enough to buyback $20b shares in itself. Why wouldn’t u believe in them, they are proven, the future and not going away!"
2025-08-15,I'd go RDDT. I did buy $8k worth of NVDA last week but I'm planning to dump it before earnings. I'm hoping for a pump up but so far it's been flat.
2025-08-19,"NVDA will likely not be top player in ten years.  Graphics cards are not ideal for AI processing, they are just what is available.  Somebody is going to develop a new architecture of whole computer that runs AI in a much more energy efficient way.  

I think OP should invest that money in a company that is NOT the most valuable company in the world.  NVDA has limited upside and incredible down side risk."
2025-08-15,Why two weeks? Wait till nvidia earnings?
2025-08-15,"I’d say to most people that unless you really know how to buy and sell stocks, just get VOO. You get a large chunk of Nvidia with a nice side of diversity."
2025-08-16,Might not see a dip. If nvda kills earnings it may fly. The dip might happen when it's at 220.
2025-08-15,"It’s not really that crazy unless he’s taking immense amounts of value in what people are saying, otherwise I see no issue in getting an overview of what people think on the stock"
2025-08-19,Maybe it bait. If he’s smart he will have gathered enough intel in these responses to know his sell signal is approaching
2025-08-20,Want to ask your take on paypal buybacks but its stock not performing well
2025-08-15,Reckon itll pump after earnings?
2025-08-18,Nvda is reporting its earnings
2025-08-17,"I’m sorry which META are folks referring to here? The one trading on the nasdaq at $785.23 USD per share? Price is so high already. Unless ppl are referring to buying fractional shares? 

Thanks!"
2025-08-16,It will dip if it kills earnings… it always dips
2025-08-15,"I guess so. The real answer is do it, but only if you are willing to hold. If you don’t need the 5000k for 3 years or more, I’d go all in or a 50/50 split with Meta."
2025-08-15,Hell yeah. Made $6k already this month. Maybe $13k in total since they went public. I just buy and sell. I might hold longer this time though.
2025-08-15,"I’m not stating this as fact—just my take. The guy asked which names are running, and short term I think NVDA and META look stronger going into next week. We’ll be getting Fed rate clarity, more resolution on the tariff issues, and earnings from our star player—the first $4T company ever. There’s a lot of key information on the horizon. Less cryptic? Go buy bitcoin, its down ALOT in the last 24 hrs."
2025-08-19,“AI bubble!” I see on other subs but money is being made. I’m going to keep holding!
2025-08-14,"Well, I've got 2000 shares right now."
2025-08-15,That’s nothing. Try 2001 shares
2025-08-17,"Sure, but now they know what works and problems to solve.  It won't be long before they catch up."
2025-08-15,"FUD.  

I'm actually kind of impressed how resilient the stock price has been over the last couple of weeks.  In the past quarters news like this would have triggered a 3% drop.  There is really strong support at 180 right now. 

I wish I knew what that would mean for the ER.  If I had to hazard a guess, it would be a pretty small move, but I have no idea which direction.  That guess would be at odds with the implied move based on options...that ranges from +/- 6 to 12%.

As much as NVDA has run up the last four months it's hard to imagine a 12% jump...that would put it above $200.  But I really don't think we're gonna see a big sell-off either.  It's pretty obvious the ER is going to be bananas good.  So I'm compromising at a small jump."
2025-08-14,somebody really wants to buy the dip ... really determined you might say.
2025-08-14,I don't really appreciate these braindead posts because it makes me feel like I'm in the $AMC or $GME subreddits.
2025-08-14,Down with NVDA (so I can buy the dip)
2025-08-14,"As someone with a really red short short position, OP manning the trenches brings me hope"
2025-08-15,1000$ wtf you talking this bs
2025-08-14,Beat beat and raise. All good.
2025-08-14,"If we gp through a minor correction before then it will go sideways. If we go through a more than 5% it will go up... Look at history.

If it goes up then it will become priced in. If nvda shatters expectations then we can only go up ( more than 10% above estimates)"
2025-08-14,Down; end of summer into September profit taken ripple effect/// hedge funds rebalancing into the first week of October 137–1 47
2025-08-14,"Who knows, maybe it will be priced in beforehand"
2025-08-15,"It's been relatively flat lately. Bad jobs data, bad inflation data, mixed China news, but the company is solid with a great outlook. I'm 99% sure it'll rip, which means it probably won't. Haha. Thoughts and prayers for my calls."
2025-08-16,Beat earnings and the stock goes down. That seems to be the pattern
2025-08-15,We're only getting started. Buy more
2025-08-14,It’s all good. Just hold…. Maybe buy some more if you can.
2025-08-14,NVDA has enough problems juggling two weird governments that it's probably wise not to consider any income from China (for now)
2025-08-14,Hold for me. Will review post earnings.
2025-08-15,Jensen is brilliant. I'm sure NVDA will reach $5 trillion soon. Then $10 trillion
2025-08-14,"12 mth price target, not 2 week target"
2025-08-14,"Yes. The markets expectations for earnings is ridiculous.  If they don’t blow it out, it will pull back. And those price target are not for the next 3 months. 
They had these targets at 180-200 for a long time now and it was stuck at 150 for the longest"
2025-08-14,Always a hold for me.
2025-08-14,"no, it's an update to their 2025 target.  Unless specified, all targets are for end of year and they wouldn't be publishing a 2026 end of year target yet."
2025-08-14,I can see that. What is missing in most people's understanding of this is that this price target is for next summer and not this summer. $180 seems a tad high now if $225 indeed happens next summer
2025-08-15,"I think you got it mixed up, Piper targets are all 12 mth targets unless specified. Same for most other equity research publications."
2025-08-14,"My suggestion, as someone who is in the same boat as you with 175Cs expiring in November. My approach is to sit on them until they're about a week from expiration, and let theta do some work on them. Then at that point, obviously depending on where NVDA is at, either let them expire worthless (ideal) or roll them out for a higher strike. If NVDA has a dip somewhere between now and the expiration date, I highly suggest closing them out for a profit. For me, if I can get 75% of the premium out of them, I'll be happy. Additionally, I'm also writing a few 150 puts w/ the same expiration as my CCs to gather some extra premium. 

 I'm welcome to reading any critiques or suggestions regarding my plan/advice."
2025-08-14,Look at how much extrinsic value is left. If your goal is to make 2-3% a month and by holding these to the strike date you make less on the extrinsic value than your profit goal just close them out and make a new trade.
2025-08-14,"This is classic. Congratulations on your win. Your CC are not under water because you won more on the shares than you lost on the calls

You sold your calls too far out. Do not roll them out making it worse. Who knows, these calls may expire worthless. We don't know what NVDA will trade for in January

Do you think NVDA is worth $170? All you have to do is to sell some puts for December 2025. You get $9 for $165 strike and $13 for a $175 strike. How much premium did you get for your calls?"
2025-08-14,"I'm in the same boat, but I bought back in 2020.  I really need to reallocate as NVDA is a large % of my port. I'm letting some go @ $175, $180, and $200. CC's expiring EOY."
2025-08-15,It’s hard when it’s bull market. I’ve stuck to weekly calls or non at all.
2025-08-14,Own shares. Stop gambling...
2025-08-14,"Makes sense, my only thing is we have two earnings till they expire.  

Are you selling puts or buying puts with the 150 strike?"
2025-08-15,I’m at 160 ugh 😑 I swear everytime I sell one it starts mooning like crazy - should have re bought the last dip couple weeks ago when it got close to 170
2025-08-14,"Hmm ok, so let’s say I got 10$ for the 165 strike. 

I agree rolling up and out helps 0% if I think it’s gonna keep going up. (Without a giant crash)

You suggest just sell puts for Dec? The collateral is so much though. 1k premium to hold 16k at the 160 strike."
2025-08-16,I’m in the same boat as you. Bought a bunch in 2018/2019. Sold a bunch in 2023 and have a ton left. Sold 22 Dec 195 CCs about a month ago and convinced myself that I’d be happy to let it all go at 195. If not I was able to pocket $150k for 5 months work. And will look to do the same every six months.  The only flaw in this plan is a total collapse of the market.
2025-08-14,"It’s 100$ a week, or the stock moving 1$ per week.  I feel like it may under water forever if NVDA keeps on this pace."
2025-08-14,"The title literally saying covered calls, I own the shares."
2025-08-14,"Selling, call it hedging against your CCs."
2025-08-14,"I'm sorry. I assumed you had a margin account. I sell puts ""for free"" in my margin account"
2025-08-16,"Absolutely. WWIII, COVID20 etc. . I'm letting the $175 go...  Hopefully.  I was able to roll my $180's  to $190's today after Trump opened his mouth."
2025-08-14,I’m referring to the strike price you roll for. I do it on ITM ccs all the time. You still make money off it it’s just not a lot and you can’t forever. Only because money you pay to roll forward is netted for the same you gain on the higher strike
2025-08-14,"Ok I think that’s my confusion.  Let’s say your selling puts at 150.  You are locking up 15k in collateral till November? If it stays the same or goes up, you make the premium and it if goes down, you buy the 100 shares and then your ITM shares now expire worthless?

Just confirming."
2025-08-14,All the premiums were invested to get more shares.
2025-08-14,"If NVDA stays above 150 until November then I collect the premium from the puts. I do not want to buy at 150, so if NVDA drops then I will roll them out farther and w/ a smaller strike price for a larger premium. Over the long run NVDA is likely only going to increase, so IMO rolling out puts for this particular stock is probably safer than rolling out calls."
2025-08-14,Why wouldn't you buy the shares at $150? You think its going lower than that?
2025-08-14,"Interesting, Robinhood?

Basically, they figure you got the cash to buy the shares because you could always sell your shares.  Makes sense.

Is there a max? Or could you do it on all your shares, across multiple stocks?  What’s the downside?"
2025-08-14,"I'd rather take the $15k and put it towards diversification. NVDA as of now is the bulk of my portfolio, and I don't want to give it more weight at this time."
2025-08-14,"I have margin equity based on the holdings in my account. Different equities have different margin requirements 30%-100%. Non volatile stocks and most ETF require 30% so basically 70% of my balance is maintenance excess that I can use to buy on margin (for an interest), withdraw (for an interest), or use to secure short puts (free if I don't get assigned over my head by stocks that went to $0)

I see no drawback. I balance my short puts and covered calls and it mostly works great"
2025-08-14,"The only drawback would be getting burned on a steep drop, but I guess stop loss on your shares within 90% of your put strike price would protect you from massive damage."
2025-08-14,"I currently hold 29 positions of short puts (and 55 positions short calls). I have enough ""safe"" Investments that I could take a big drop and I also watch it constantly during regular market hours

Interesting is that short puts are \*less\* risky than holding shares"
2025-08-13,"Close to earnings, let the circus begin"
2025-08-14,"Oh, Ok 👌🏼… I’ll sell everything. Fucking asshats, STFU."
2025-08-14,NVIDIA was collaborating with said company. So yes NVIDIA has access to their technology. If they lose the lawsuit NVIDIA will not be able to sell their server racks in Europe. The case certainly has merit.
2025-08-13,"It's a rumor. 

A report after GTC 2025: 

""CEO Jensen Huang took the stage at the SAP Center to show off the processor, which will succeed the company’s new Blackwell Ultra chip when it begins shipping in the second half of 2026.""

Rubin wasn’t planned to be on the ground until around this time next year. They'll make adjustments, but that's part of rolling out a new architecture."
2025-08-13,There’s $190 put at 3 million. Careful
2025-08-14,"Lisa Su is no joke, and Jensen knows her well. Jensen takes continuous improvement very seriously. Even though many announcements are made along the path of product development, the rollouts always tend to surprise to the upside with less power consumption and more processing power. This is where competition is a great thing for our country and our investments. At some point, NVDA will hit some temporary, perceived limit, like 1 nanometer chips, and AMD will get close enough to force NVDA’s margins down a bit, better for all consumers once AI is more a part of our lives in a more thorough fashion. I could see AI running a household once everything in the house is controlled digitally. Conversations with “agentic” AI lets the machine know your preferences for everything, like who to let in the house by facial recognition, temperature and humidity, what lights go on and when and how bright, what cameras are recording, etc."

2025-08-14,Its options flow. Usually if you see significant amount of $$$ with multiple orders it could mean they know something and are trying to get in before news hits or they know earnings may not do well.
2025-08-14,"There are lots of cases where an open source competitor has gained market share against a dominant platform. Linux and Android are two successes. But Linux and Android are hardware-independent. ROCm is tied to AMD GPUs, which are made from TSMC wafers etc, same as Nvidia. If you're in the data center business, there's no compelling reason to switch and buy AMD GPUs instead of Nvidia's. 

Nvidia's real potential competition would be from China. If China can develop a competing open platform that is hardware independent, then Nvidia's moat could be in danger. That's why Jensen has been so focused on getting Nvidia chips licensed to sell in China, to prevent that from happening."
2025-08-14,Youre clueless. Nvidia is software AI company and has whole ecosystem to sell. Amd doesnt. Nobody spends billions for buggy system that has problems

2025-08-14,Buy and have a 2 year outlook within two years nvidia will be double by stock price so every dollar u save will go towards ur future self just my opinion no point worrying about day to day price moves unless ur adding strategically
2025-08-13,"Depends on how much you have and your risk tolerance.

If you're only talking about a small amount, putting it all in with the knowledge that you will continuously contribute would be more akin to simply DCA which is perfect 

If the amount is larger and or a lump sum that you don't plan on continuously contributing to splitting it up into smaller investments over time would probably be more wise 

If it is simply a small amount though feel free to just dump it and continuously contribute"
2025-08-13,"The best approach is not to buy all your funds at once. You can purchase a portion and keep some funds waiting. If the price drops, you can continue to increase your holdings to reduce costs (this is only suitable for long-term investment)."

2025-08-13,"Do 1/2 portion now and 90 day limit order for $170 for whatever you’re scared of putting in. TBH I put big order in June and up 50% since then. At that time I thought it was going to drop further but steadily kept going up. NVDA makes money, beats expectations, can’t keep up with demand, and is only game in town for now. Gonna ride the wave until they get competition probably couple more years."
2025-08-13,Lots of people were waiting for it to go to the $120s when it was in the 150s. And it's $183 and change this AM.
2025-08-14,"I didn’t buy NVDA a year ago because “it was too high”. Then I didn’t buy 6 months ago because “I missed the bus, it won’t go up any more”. Clearly I was wrong, now I buy NVDA. If you research the company and its financials etc, they’re in a strong position to keep growing. It’s a single stock so it’s always more risky than an index fund or etf, and yes hype is driving this, but there’s more to it than the hype; there real growth here"

2025-08-12,The share price is determined by how much people are willing to pay for it.  The P/E return against time as a measure is not how the market operates in the modern world.
2025-08-13,"\>The current forward PE (price to earnings) ratio of the stock is about 42. The highest it's ever been.

Stopped reading there."
2025-08-13,"""The current forward PE (price to earnings) ratio of the stock is about 42. The highest it's ever been.""

This isn't the highest forward they've had. It was 44.64x in July 2024. I'm not sure what the highest has been.

We're on an old nanometer node. Blackwell wasn't supposed to use the same node as Hopper. I didn't expect the revenue increases we've had by using an existing node with a new architecture. We may see better growth when Rubin releases, and as big customers continue to increase ROI to increase the rate at which they increase CapEx each year. 

There's so much data center construction going on right now (Stargate etc). Rubin, plus these massive data centers is going to make for a lot of growth in 2027-2028. We'll hopefully get an idea for what 2029-2030 is going to look like in next year's GTC."
2025-08-13,Just keep buying every dip (like the one from this morning) and keep stacking shares.
2025-08-13,"I enjoyed the post, I’d say investors believe in growth exploding over the next few years and you see it in the current price. People see the growth of AI as inevitable and a catalyst for long term strong growth. 

I agree that it’s a bit overzealous at current prices. The current expectations given the share price are a flawless return to China and continuing to scale without further interruption. 

Q3 guidance will test a lot of people’s theories about the rest of 2025, and people will probably start thinking about 2026 on the call during questions. 

Im waiting til the report and aftermath to make any decisions"
2025-08-14,"I’m way too dumb to understand any of this. My simple thought is that AI is still in the early stages and it’s going to explode over the next 3-5 years and Nvidia is in a great position to make incredible profits from that.  For that reason, I think it’s still a buy and I would not worry at all if there is a “correction” or it’s down one day or up another.  Buy and hold."
2025-08-13,"Your analysis hits on real risks—NVDA's forward P/E at around 42 screams ""priced for perfection,"" and that logarithmic EPS chart does show growth decelerating from explosive to merely impressive, with the linear one highlighting quarterly wobbles that could spook momentum chasers. But let's dissect this rationally without the doomscroll vibe.

First, the charts: The log scale reveals EPS compounding at a robust clip through FY2024, but the recent flattening suggests the AI hype train is hitting physics—diminishing returns as data center demand matures. Actual points on the linear graph show peaks and a slight Q4 FY2025 dip, aligning with reports of Blackwell delays and softening guidance, yet analysts like those at Goldman Sachs (per recent CNBC notes) just hiked targets to $220+, betting on $126B data center revenue by 2027. That's not exponential forever, but it's not a cliff either.

You're spot-on that retail euphoria ignores basics: NVDA's $4.5T market cap implies god-mode growth, outpacing Apple/MSFT despite their moats. Competition isn't zero—AMD's chipping away with MI300 series, and posts on X echo bets on them catching up faster than NVDA adds trillions. Inevitable, sure, like death and taxes, but NVDA's CUDA ecosystem locks in 90% share for now, and cloud capex surges (up 51% projected for 2025 per some forecasts) fuel Blackwell ramps.

Bear case strong: If EPS growth slows to 20-30% YoY (vs. 100%+ past), that P/E compresses hard, especially with algo bots amplifying volatility. Pullback? Likely, as Yahoo Finance pieces note decelerating financials and minimal dividends. But the market's pricing in $5+ EPS for CY2025, with PEG at 0.6 (cheap vs. Mag7 peers), per Bank of America updates. Consensus from 64 analysts is ""Buy"" with $228 average target—hardly a bubble pop.

Short-term, yeah, overbought; I'd trim if holding. Long-term, NVDA's AI dominance could justify it, unless rivals or regulation bite. Dry humor aside, calling it ""too high for investable value"" is like saying the sun's too bright—true until it sets profits ablaze again. What's your exit price?

2025-08-14,"I don't think there's an expectation at this point of 2023/2024 level growth anymore.  It's been more than a year since that ended.  But there is a real, and probably valid expectation, that NVDA will remain the only AI hardware game in town for the next several years, which will lead to hyper profits anyway, if not exponentially increasing CAGRs."

2025-08-12,"Dude, just buy 10 more shares and sell weekly out of the money calls."
2025-08-12,Buy more for 10 years
2025-08-12,"If you sell now, you'll need to report it in taxes. Just hold it."
2025-08-12,"As wise folks already suggested, don't sell unless you need the cash, if good dip comes try buying more"
2025-08-12,If you want to swing trade then sure. It might go lower in short term. But if I was you I'd not touch it for years to come. There's no way but up for nvda. No competition
2025-08-12,"Hi everybody! Thank you for all the comments and advice! Just some quick information, like I said I am pretty much an amateur who during my college years bought some ETFs and chip stocks like NVDA and AMD. It just so happened to split twice during my holding from the 2020 crash and I didn’t sell 30 shares until earlier this year. Although I’m working now and have a stable income, I’m not as comfortable buying so much yet and just wanted to know some people’s thoughts because I just found this subreddit. I see a lot of people are suggesting doing covered calls which I’d like to know more about if anyone has any advice! I’d also like to learn more about some things I can do to grow my financial future since I’m very new in my career. Thank you for the support!"
2025-08-13,"General rule of thumb from my personal experience, if you’re ever questioning if you should sell or not, you should probably sell some."
2025-08-13,3200 shares and planning on holding for years to come. This is a generational wealth building opportunity
2025-08-12,I’d buy 10 more shares and write covered calls . Collect premiums as long as your hearts content.
2025-08-12,I can’t imagine buying nvda at this price!! I only started buying about 2 years ago.
2025-08-12,Hold bro
2025-08-12,Why did you stop buying in the first place? Only 90 shares since you bought at 7.21?
2025-08-12,Sell 10K and deploy to 5 other growth stocks? Watch for taxes though
2025-08-12,"Put more money into it


Or also take that 16k and buy a car (screw it it'll be a fun story you can tell the kids) then put more money into nvdia"
2025-08-12,Why didnt you keep buying????
2025-08-12,Hold for another 4 year with at least $5k. Play with the other $10k
2025-08-12,"If you are a trader, why wouldn’t you sell?"
2025-08-12,"Sell some, transfer some profit, get a beer 😋later you will regret"
2025-08-12,Buy 10 more and do covered call
2025-08-12,It's inevitably going over 200 and probably this year so I'd wait till then at least but I wouldn't be in a rush to sell
2025-08-12,"Sell and do MSTR jan 2026 calls.

Easy money printer."
2025-08-12,Sell 10% whenever it breaks ATH by 10% and buy 15% whenever it drops 33% from new ATH
2025-08-12,"Hold
I bought at 21 USD, bought more and still holding."
2025-08-12,So this is why it's good to have a goal in mind. Have you taken enough profit yet? Do you want to free up the funds in order to make more plays? What is your goal here?
2025-08-12,Sell
2025-08-12,"Is this a troll? If not then why sell? You’re making money dude, keep making money. Unless you are hard up for cash and really need it to get by you should let it ride."
2025-08-12,"10 shares and sell covered calls. Each tranche will be like a 100% of original investment!

Be aware you can/will eventually lose the shares doing this. Dont do it if you expect a huge rally. But... youre asking about selling, so.  


Im also an AI bear, but i think we have a ways to go on the AI superglide till it falls apart (though gpt5 is showing some cracks, it also shows all the people reliant on it. Also nvda isnt some moonshot on AI. Theyre selling the equipment already)"
2025-08-12,Consider buying some stock in the platform you are posting on. Sell some shares and put it into Reddit. Just my two cents 💲😎
2025-08-13,Holy shit $7!!!  You would have been a millionaire if you loaded up!
2025-08-13,"I have 1500 shares just hold off 125 shares. There’s a lot better opportunities out there took me a couple years to 100% on nvidia  took me two months to 200% on Coreweave. 

Or NBIS 100% my money in four months"
2025-08-12,"Holding for a 5 year window is not unreasonable. Continue to monitor company performance and general market conditions. Right now AI is a growing capability for most companies. They will continue to invest in this technology as well as cloud storage, cyber security companies, other technologies that will enhance business operations- visions systems, voice recognition, and the like."
2025-08-12,You lost $25 today…. Might as well just quit and cut the losses now
2025-08-12,"I did a whole sell and bought again at the price i had gotten it at. So it’s like 1,018 shares instead of 509 shares. That’s a win for me."
2025-08-12,Sell some and buy a 2x ETF on Tesla
2025-08-12,Sell 10 shares
2025-08-12,"Hold, they probably won’t grow at the pace AMD will in the next few years, but still, Nvidia is King of the chip. You’ll thank yourself in 2030."

2025-08-12,Sell
2025-08-13,"Hold and don’t buy until after the earnings report (ER). It should dip in the week after the ER, then buy the dip."
2025-08-13,I sold 200 at 153$ and happy sitting on it or having it in something boring and simple. Right now just cash. Im now very happy with my profit and ready to jump back if I feel I want to. Or it just goes to the safe retirement fund. If you are concerned that it will drop but your other side is saying it will go up. Take some off the table but not all.
2025-08-13,"Sell none, buy more"
2025-08-13,Hold hold hold!!!!!
2025-08-13,"Asking this in a Nvidia subreddit is just asking for a biased answer. These redditors don’t know what a market cap is and think Nvidia will get to $400 a share or something crazy which would make their market cap around 9 trillion. Unless they do something else astonishing that other AI companies can’t reproduce in the near future they are in no way reaching 9 Trillion market cap. 

For reference that would be 3.5x larger than Google & 4x larger than Meta. I would hold but won’t plan on accumulating more shares. 

Just slight news on China releasing new AI tech would tank Nvidia."
2025-08-13,Sell some and buy 100 ULTY then use distribution for SCHG or VGT
2025-08-13,"If you can get 10 more shares you would have 100 shares and then you can just sell covered calls on those for easy weekly or monthly income, while also gaining money from the stock going up, nvidea still has a lot of room to grow."

2025-08-14,Wow! When did you buy at $7?
2025-08-14,The answer is you don't ever sell this stock unless you don't want to make money
2025-08-15,Buy 10 shares and sell covered calls
2025-08-15,Hold. Will be $200 a share by Christmas.
2025-08-15,You should have bought a LOT more at $7 per share.

2025-08-12,"Why you all keep saying buy more buy more? Maybe he is not in position to buy the stock financially now! 

If that was easy, no one would lose at investing"
2025-08-14,do people just come to reddit for validation and attention?
2025-08-12,"I would’ve been buying more during each dip, nvdia ain’t going anywhere so if you don’t need the money hold and buy more"
2025-08-12,Or sell calls at $220. That’s basically free money for a while.
2025-08-12,"Good strategy for NVDA with leading-edge technologies, dominance in market share, great cash flow, and continued growth."
2025-08-12,Thats called greed honestly.  Anytime you get huge gains always sell some and keep some.  Anything can happen in the future and we cannot predict.
2025-08-13,If I have 100 shares sell a call or a put?
2025-08-12,Same boat and I’m holding as well
2025-08-16,"I’m pretty new to investing, I’m curious how do you know what stocks to invest in early? Like how did you know to invest back then for this specific stock? I need to get in on some newer ones that have potential for growth in the future so I can get some good returns like this post and you lol"
2025-08-12,"He bought it in 2020, already long"
2025-08-15,"You’d have to buy 10 more shares to sell a covered call. A call is 100 shares. Basically you’re agreeing to sell your shares at a price higher than market price today. You can choose the price, and if NVDA doesn’t hit that price, you get to keep your shares plus the premium you collected. That’s why people are saying buy 10 more shares, then sell a covered call against those shares at a price way out of the money (far higher than the current price). That way you are earning income on your shares (as long as the strike price you choose is higher than the end price on the expiration date) while you’re holding them. And worst case, you have to sell them at a price higher than today’s current market price. It’s a great way to make residual income off shares you’re holding. Just be careful about the strike price you choose. Because you said you’re an amateur, I’d go far out of the money, meaning a very high price. You won’t get as much premium, but your risk of having to sell the shares will be much lower."
2025-08-14,"Hi, I’m very new to a lot of this and was wondering if you had any personal resources or articles that explain covered calls, financial strategies, etc that would be good for me to look into. I know I can always google or AI it, but having someone recommend something they liked I think is always great. Thanks!"
2025-08-12,Maybe he is. Maybe he lost $16k on other stocks and he is thinking about selling this to compensate
2025-08-12,Umm this is a Nvidia subreddit. Why are you here?
2025-08-13,I’m selling $200 calls.
2025-08-15,I’d buy 10 more and sell calls too.
2025-08-13,But they only have 90 shares.
2025-08-13,If you have 100 shares you sell covered calls
2025-08-14,"When you have 100 shares of NVDA, you can begin selling call options to collect premiums."
2025-08-13,"You can sell an option (a call) to somebody at a strike price above the stock’s current price within a specified time frame. That person pays you a premium (cold hard cash) the second you sell them the option. If the stock rises above the strike price within that time, you will be forced to sell to them at that price (and the person who bought the option will turn around and sell them for more). People love covered calls bc you’re not risking money, only profits."
2025-08-14,So I learned what I do from Americandreamtrading all one word in YouTube . You will have to scroll and find the ones talking in covered calls. But the guy is very knowledgeable and does a ton of videos .
2025-08-13,They were adding to the comment above after buying 10 more shares
2025-08-16,"It wasn’t all luck, but some was involved. Jim Cramer was always talking about Nvidia back in 2017, 2018, 2019 due to computer gaming components. Nothing big back then about AI. But I thought it was expensive at the time. Then Covid happened in 2020, a big dip, so I invested $6000. Another dip in 2021, invested $12000. Another small dip in 2022, invested $1300. Ai stared taking off and the rest is history. Biggest thing for me was that they were a very solid company when I bought, nothing speculative. Solid balance sheet."
2025-08-13,Got it. I'd be selling calls too then.
2025-08-14,So if I don’t want to lose my shares or atleast I hope not to I use .2 or less depending on how bad I want to keep my stock. Of course the premium is not as juicy as a .3 or .4 but that’s probably why yours got called away . Also nvida jumped like crazy last few years so writing anything then was hard not to get called away .
2025-08-14,"Agreed, it’s hard for me to write calls when premium isn’t juicy. Especially when you can have 10 successful , but then one moon shot gets your shares called"
2025-08-15,"That’s why I prefer to sell covered calls and puts on leveraged ETFs that have juicy premiums, but lower overall cost, like NVDL. But I only do it on leveraged ETFs where I believe in the underlying equity and don’t mind getting assigned or having to hold the shares. And I take much lower risk for lower premium, but I’m okay with that. Has helped me outperform the market time and again."
2025-08-12,"Would you give $3 for the opportunity to make $17-$25?  Just add a bunch of zeros to those numbers, it’s still a huge opportunity for those companies involved"
2025-08-12,Could have had a 15% tariff on every chip they import. 15% of China revenue is a huge benefit vs a tariff.
2025-08-12,It's money to open a market. It's money. Money drives the market higher. How is this bad? Call Trump whatever you want. This is good news.
2025-08-11,Sell all then
2025-08-11,So many bearish posts makes me feel really good about my calls
2025-08-11,Not until October
2025-08-11,Been in since 2018 but deciding to sell in October. Ya okay. Someone missed the boat. 😂
2025-08-11,Good luck to you both 😂🤦‍♂️
2025-08-11,shut up ..i wanted the dip to buy the dip to make money from the dip .. now i am just swimming in my 20k i didn't use .. disappointed
2025-08-11,"ok mr positivity, i will buy in, after it has already 5000000x and 1% dip."
2025-08-11,"Let's see how far the dip goes Made another $4k on 2 days last week. Sold at the top on Friday.

All cash right now."

2025-08-16,The post of someone that spent their life savings on 2 shares at the peak.
2025-08-11,Can anyone explain WHY we would do this? Essentially we were saying the Ai race is too important to win so we are going to ban chips from being sold to our largest competitor.  Now are we saying the potential to lose the race is only worth 15%?  What keeps the Administration from arbitrarily raising this fee whenever it wants?  Seems like a bad precedent to set
2025-08-11,NVDA and AMD should just raise their prices for China.
2025-08-12,It might be affordable for these high-profit companies but the precedent is insane.  Like comedic local dictator in  post-soviet republic level of interference in the market.
2025-08-11,"I suppose that's the price to play ball, but couldn't they just shiip a lot of them to Singapore or other countries in SE Asia to skirt the tax? Not that I would condone that tax avoidance lol"
2025-08-11,"How is this a negative at all? As much as I disagree with the methods... I just don't see how 15% tariff on sales is better than NOT being allowed to sell to China.

Can someone explain what I'm missing here? How is this negatively affecting stock price when it seems like it should be a good thing for shareholders and the company, by every metric?"
2025-08-11,"That would mean that US government would encourage more chip selling to China 🇨🇳 
Money money money money, moneeeeey"
2025-08-11,"Hear me out. What do you call it when companies file small income tax bills and have substantial revenue?


https://itep.org/55-profitable-corporations-zero-corporate-tax/


I don't like the guy either, or the way this came about, but after thinking about this I'm kind of unsure of how to think about it. "
2025-08-12,"Even if AMD and NVDA do not pass the 15 percent charge to the Chinese buyers, it’s still a good deal for extra revenue to both of them; otherwise the NVDA’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips would have been banned.  Both stock prices’ll likely go up further."
2025-08-11,"Not saying I agree or disagree.   You asked a question so I am going to try and explain.

Basically Trump administration is split on selling advanced chips to China.  This is the compromise.  Its protectionism.  

The Administration believes that selling chips to China creates a negative externality to the US by quickening or accelerating China’s own chip production.  Same thing that happened with IBM and Apple.  So NVDA and its shareholders will temporarily benefit but to the detriment of the US in the long run by selling our advanced chips to China.  

So this excise tax (tariff/export duty) is designed to allow the US tax payer to also benefit if only temporarily."
2025-08-12,So buy Google?
2025-08-11,"The alternative was in place until months ago: sales to China of toned down chips, without paying money to the US government to be allowed to do it.

Now it’s selling those chips but handing over revenue to the US gov…"
2025-08-11,"idk what's wrong with people in pre-market:

\- 1) Trump just did this to Apple (increase of $100 billion to $600 billion total)

\- 2) Which cleared the way for Apple to build iPhone overseas in India (no tariffs)

\- 3) Apple's price surged 📈

**\*This is a sign of trust and future economic boom—a classic sign/easy tell—from DJT.\***"
2025-08-11,Dude I have sold calls on my shares. Dont make it jump more. Its enough. Come on. Lets keep forward p/e at 35-40 please
2025-08-11,"I'd like to see $140 before that, so I can get some more."
2025-08-11,Think net numbers.  15% less of any value greater than zero is an improvement.  Today revenue to China is zero.  So NVDA is now paying zero percent of zero.
2025-08-11,15% of Chinese sales. Do you think 0% revenue from China is better than 85%? Or do you think there’s deeper issues?
2025-08-11,"First point, think net numbers.  This will result in an increase in revenue.

Second point, the GOP’s concern (not mine) with selling chips in China is it could create a negative net externality to Americans if China just copies the chips.  

In the administration’s mind NVDA would profit at US detriment by helping to accelerate China’s development of ai chips.  I personally think this protectionist thought is backwards as not selling chips in China would accelerate China’s domestic chips.  Think rubber embargo which resulted in China planting its own rubber plants.  

However, I am mot an elected official just an investor and this 15% export duty is the administrations win-win solution.  Now the US tax payer benefits from NVDA’s selling chips to China.  Again I am against protectionism it does not work.

Third point is that this is essentially an export duty."
2025-08-11,"We have a government being run like the mafia.

Tho I disagree with your assement. They weren't making any money and now they will be getting 85% of a large market. 

NVDA might go up more because of this, not down. Tho I wouldnt mind a drop...my $185 CCs are in jeopardy."
2025-08-11,Anyone who doesn't see the good in this please sell me your shares I'll pay 175 Monday morning just don't cry when I have them up at 225 next month.
2025-08-12,"I am not an expert in constitutional law.  I really can’t contribute on that.  Whether it is or not is going to come down to if he gets sued over it or challenged.  For now, I believe this news is bullish for NVDA at least in the short term."
2025-08-11,"If you really had 265 mil you wouldn’t need to post every day on Reddit about “futes” trying to pump the stock. Presumably, you’d have better things to do."
2025-08-11,Keep buying calls near ATH’s I love to see the loss porn 🤤
2025-08-12,"I OWN shares for long term, not calls.  You don't have the money to own shares obviously"

They don't understand cause they've never had money.  It's like Trump tweeting at 4 am.  He is rich, but it doesn't excite him anymore, so he gets bored ..."
2025-08-12,I only got there cause my grandmother left me $150 mil to start with....
2025-08-11,"#Yea folks here lack basic math skills.    

##Nvidia's AI chip sales guidance from China was $0 (Nvidia ssid they were losing $15B from the ban)     
##AMD's AI chip sales guidance from China was $0 (from Aug 5th)      

Both CEOs were not able to sell AI chips in China.   

So 85% of any sale is better than $0 from China.  

#Counter arguments I've heard :

1) Market already knew abt this approval coming - Could be true or false
2) Nvidia was shipping to China (via Sinapore, India) - Well definitely not making $15B there and now China market opens up legally."
2025-08-11,"It's dangerous to blind yourself to arguments that go against  your perma-bull mindset. The folks who invested at the top of last summer remember this all too well. They, too, believed the markets only go up, and that nvidia's momentum is unstoppable. Oh, how well they learned that no stock only goes up. There were some guys there that put 100 to 300k in calls because Nvidia earnings were always free money since 2023 and couldn't fathom how this behemoth of a company could ever drop. Well, it did, and their moneys went bye-bye.   
  
Always have risk management in mind.  Even when you feel nothing can ever go wrong."
2025-08-11,"They have rallied from the China announcement but it started earlier with earnings from TMSC, Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon. Over $300b in CAPEX in the coming year."
2025-08-11,"I would not call it a nothing burger.  It is moderately bullish to my reading:

https://www.perplexity.ai/search/ef071031-746d-4616-bdc4-28eb12fba7bd

You don’t want to guess at news. Understand whatever you have time for. And think how hard you have hopefully saved to get what you have. Give your cash respect. Lots of knee jerk fully off base comments oftentimes on here."
2025-08-11,Good advice regardless of the sentiment
2025-08-11,"You are not even wrong on this.  

I think OP’s point is this news is a nothing burger.  We should not be blinded by erroneous information.  It’s just noise.  At the end of the day, 15% export duty on any revenue greater than zero is better news then we currently exist in.  Today they pay zero percent on zero.  

Stock price is the expectation for future cashflows.  NPV.  Future cashflows are now expected to grow.  China made up, what, 12% of revenues before they were banned.  

Nvda still has good price to sales ratio and a good PEG ratio."
2025-08-11,If you invested anytime last year even at its highest you’re still up over $30/share. Sure there were better times to buy but you’re still up a significant % overall and beating the S&P average.
2025-08-11,Nothing ever goes up in a straight line. Everyone went from perma bear to perma bull on Nvidia. It’s a great company but it’s due for a pullback. Take some profits and buy the dip
2025-08-11,"Of course. Long term always wins. I was tailoring my advice towards those with a shorter term view, who think the bull run will keep running and running without a reprieve, or those that do ridiculously risky options like 220+ strike with 3-4 months expirations. Can it get there? MAYBE! Is it worth the risk, in my opinion. after this kind of a run? Hell no. 

AFAIK Nvidia might be priced for perfection yet again if it's heading into earnings pumped full of greed and hopium"
2025-08-11,You have a unique chance to buy high and sell low. I think buying calls will be your fastest method to lose $10k

2025-08-11,"Sure, the next NVDA dip will be at $200 after soaring to $220+ becoming the first $5 Trillion dollar company."
2025-08-11,Nvidia will just mark their prices up an additional  +15% and all will be good.
2025-08-11,So what. They currently make $0 from China so any incoming monies are an increase. Even if 15% is taken out of it. 🤦‍♂️
2025-08-11,"If NVDA wasn’t going to make a profit on this deal, they wouldn’t have accepted it - they simply would have stopped selling to China instead. Cmon people use your brains…"
2025-08-11,"So you think a company that was going higher in price facing, let me check my numbers, zero revenue from China is going to tank on news that they get now 75% of china revenue, rjght that makes sense.  See you at 200 in 2026."
2025-08-11,That's why I sell calls and hold long term. I'm making money regardless.
2025-08-11,I have a 1/27 $120 call that i think im going to let ride. It’s up 122%. I’ve got plenty of time. Anyone else in a similar situation?

2025-08-11,"The market to one of the world's superpower - a huge GPU-hungry market - just opened to NDA and you think it's gonna dip?

That 15% cut is not gonna change the promise of massive profits."

2025-08-11,"Dude, 15% is a small price to pay when the revenue potential is so huge. You obviously have no idea why Nvidia is a 4.5T dollar company and why it will be 5T by the end of the year."
2025-08-12,I aint never gonna sell this stock! Was looking for another re entry point 👀
2025-08-11,"Lmao,

Why do u think nVidia wil bring less revenue now ?
Convince me and I'll sel my nVidia"
2025-08-11,I got out of NVDA/AMC at 179 but will happily buy back in sub 160 on a dip. The export duty is a transactional cost for these companies.
2025-08-11,"Replace the words ""calls"" with ""Red 7"" and this reads as a Vegas advertisement.

Nahhh I'm cool.  Buy the stock and HODL.   Take ""profits off the table"" after it's 10X'd and you are ready to print money and done."
2025-08-11,"I also heard news some Chinese outlets called the Chips not safe for Chinese market, worrisome?"
2025-08-11,China sales gets a bright green light for decades and you say that is bearish? LMAO
2025-08-11,i think China accounts for more than 15% revenue because we should also count those south east asia revenue (eg Singapore).  There’s no AI or data center here in Singapore
2025-08-11,I’m calling NVDA to jump around $250 April of next year easily. We’re entering the new age! The AI boom is here and Nvda is crafting the god candle right before our eyes!

2025-08-11,#BULLISH. MASSIVE MARKET JUST OPENED UP
2025-08-11,Im confused why people are bearish on this China news
2025-08-11,I thought this was a good thing. All uncertainty is gone.
2025-08-12,I'm barely a novice. When you say Don't buy options..if you believe the stock will drop in price don't you buy/sell? Puts?
2025-08-12,You know absolutely nothing about options if you think that the market going down is a reason not to buy options.
2025-08-12,"I’m no expert in stocks but when I read you all go back and forth speculating and timing a stock like nvdia it’s just pure entertainment. AI is not just a new watch or a new phone it is a new world order. A different life . This company so far and by far makes AI’s heart beat. As of right now this new world transformation happening before our eyes is being led by this so called god like creation ( to get the attention of the religious folks here) . Nvdia will decide the other players who can be part of the revolution.  STOP TREATING IT LIKE A STOCK. 
Invest in your new world.  Don’t trade it away. Do you really want to be that one telling your great grandchildren that you made a few bucks on their new world???"

2025-08-11,I guess you missed the bull run huh? Praying for it to drop to get in? Haha. Watch us go to $200
2025-08-11,Dumb take buy a 🤡. Bro you know nothing.
2025-08-11,These news are unconfirmed by the moment.
2025-08-11,"The problem is the Chinese economy is compressed right now with deflation ripping through the working and middle class. The 15% might be too much of a price tack on for the Chinese people to bear. 

I guess we will see, btw the Chinese still haven't agreed to allow Nvidia into their market (over security concerns) and Huawei is producing chips (at worse quality) to replace Nvidia in their market."
2025-08-12,"You are correct. It’s built to run and sustain it 
No one wants it to drop and it has institutional and retail investors.  Priced for perfection but they will continue to cover earnings and it will continue to rise.  My prediction. 

Btw I sold early. Couldn’t believe the valuations 
But - I was wrong !!  

All good tho I made bank and more off next buy 

I don’t like the crazy valuation still. 
Not w my money."
2025-08-11,"The market pumped on the relicensing news though, and at that time there was no 15% tax news."
2025-08-12,"They can easily afford it and make bank 
That’s why they signed the deal so quick w Trump 
It’s all good Nvda is unlike any company in stock market atm."
2025-08-11,Didn't they sell to China before Trump took office? Aren't they just getting back what they were already doing? Now just at a loss?
2025-08-11,Kinda similar 6/18 $132 call that’s up like 70%
2025-08-11,"Got 12/25 $144 and 03/26 $200 and I’m up 40% I bought a while back so I was in the red for a long time. 

Ar these rate tho, I am thinking of selling at $190 at least the December calls"
2025-08-11,I got some puts  sept expiration at close on Friday . will sell at open.
2025-08-11,How long do you think it’s gonna dip?
2025-08-11,"It’s priced for perfection. Now that it will lose 15% of China revenues, expect the stock to price accordingly. Additionally, with the new uncertainty, I can see investors and traders exiting their positions causing even more selling"
2025-08-11,Well didn't Pelosi buy some options?
2025-08-11,"The CCP will laugh at 15% so they won‘t get caught having Ethiopia, Cuba, Brazil, Peru and all their other buddies they’ve invested billions in to secretly buy Nvidia chips for them.  They already got caught backdoor buying chips by Singapore, Malaysian and Vietnamese governments.  Nothing will stop them from lying, cheating or stealing next level semi-conductor technology or chips."
2025-08-11,"Correct on all points.  Bear in mind however that the CCP plays three dimensional chess beyond how things appear to us. They will manipulate their citizenry, their currency, their interest rate, their economy and most importantly other countries they‘ve heavily invested in.  China, much like Russia, Iran and North Korea can shut down all Internet access, their utilities, censor any and all outside information to exercise 100% control over their present and future.  When the CCP demanded their people to only buy their government partnered smart phones it was a crime to not do so.  When their EV sales briefly slumped due to consumer pullback the CCP extended their 2022 EV rebates/subsidies through 2027.  CCP partnered industries do not have to be profitable, they just need to succeed at any cost.  One way or the other, the CCP will get their Nvidia semiconductor chips."
2025-08-11,"Hmmm…. you obviously have no idea how the CCP operates.  You only need to research how their government have no problem eliminating ideological opposition by the tens of millions since 1949.  Tiananen Square ring a bell?  Mass disappearance, imprisonment and repression of millions of Muslim Uygurs from the Eastern Xinjiang Province and Fa Lung Gong worshippers probably escaped your reading list.  On going investigation of forced labor in Chinese Apple and Nike manufacturing and assembly factories resulting in workers jumping off the building rooftops for years years sadly aren’t reported on mainstream liberal news outlets.  The CCP will bribe, steal and cheat their way to global dominance any way they can, so paying 15% tax will be a laughable win for them.  Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam have already been found out to be making straw purchases of Nvidia chips for their CCP bed buddies.  Don’t be shocked when you read about China getting Nividia chips from Ethiopia, Brazil, Peru, Cuba and others they have invested billions in over the past decades."
2025-08-12,I was buying them at $20-$60 range. I don’t think I gotta worry
2025-08-11,"Again, if it wasn’t profitable they’d say no deal and simply not sell to China. They ran the numbers and realized that even at a 15% loss, it’s still more profitable this way to sell, or China will simply pay the 15% and nvidia loses nothing in their profit margins. They didn’t have to do this, it’s a business that makes business decisions. They did this because they calculated that this is still more profitable. People panicking over this thinking the price will drop are idiots, but hey I’ll be happy to buy the dip and buy your stock after you panic sell"
2025-08-12,"Nvidia can afford it. It won’t hurt them AT ALL 
It helps them and make their earnings even better 
They will pass it on and make it up 

Jensen knows what he is doing.  Should nearly have blind faith in that guy by now.  I do"
2025-08-11,Nice. I’m going to see what the reaction is tomorrow. It may be a pullback and then come right back up. You know how people react on emotion these days
2025-08-11,"#Nvidia clearly said $0 from China in their guidance last ER. 

Same with AMD their $8.7B guidance EXCLUDES China sales (Its just from last week, go and watch th ewrnings call. Analysts kept on asking and Lisa Su said they can't give any guidance on Rev from China and eaiting for license approval and then some Rev can be added).

Now imagine both adding billions more. Seems like you don't listen to any ER."
2025-08-11,"Gimme a 10% retrace on Monday and I’ll buy 1 and 2 years LEAP.

Gimme another 10% before the end of the week. I’ll do it again!



I’m old enough to remember when Apple and google were nothing, along with Microsoft…
Less than 30 years ago things changed and I missed it. (Look at them now)

Call it what you want but a handful of companies are now in cohorts with the feds (same as back then) this time I plan to be be playing the game rather then watching from the sidelines and not profiting."
2025-08-11,In their guide they also included a fat 0 for China revenue so even at 85% its all cake right?
2025-08-12,"ok this is going to be a very dumb question...but since they can do anything they want, why can't they just copy the technology themselves? why do they need to buy them from the US"
2025-08-12,"I am waiting for a slight pull back maybe into low 170s to buy some leaps for two year expiration. I have a psychological problem when I buy leaps two  years out, it has to be 5 to 10% below the all-time high already achieved. For example, I just cannot buy out of the money leaps  for the strike of 200 since the price is not achieve reached . I feel safer that if the strike has already been reached probably it will reach again in two years. Call me stupid."
2025-08-11,If you think the stock rising to $180 doesn’t already include the expectation of China revenue I don’t think you’ve been investing for very long
2025-08-11,Everything is priced in right now
2025-08-11,"Yes both compaines inckuded $0 in their guidance from China.

This is defintiely gonna bring more money to US from China. Super auoer bullish."
2025-08-11,Tesla‘s for the W all day long!
2025-08-12,"Not a dumb question at all, the CCP will reverse engineer everything they can get their hands on and sell it.  A good percentage of Amazon products for example are Chinese counterfeits.  Did you read where three TSM engineers were found guilty today of trying to smuggle high end proprietary semi-conductor chips technology to the CCP? Trump is allowing Nvidia to resume selling them lower tier H200 chips but not the higher end architecture variety that are considered military grade."
2025-08-12,Good strategy. Sold Sept 170 puts. Let it drop so I can get a sale.
2025-08-12,And I always say patience pays $$
2025-08-11,"Margins will be also affected. It’s 15% of the revenue from China, I think that will be quite a significant impact on the operating margins"
2025-08-15,"Hey Jolly , what news sources do you generally read to stay so well informed ."
2025-08-12,Soon I hope ! Trying to get in before the earnings for two year leaps .  Hope the dip comes soon.
2025-08-12,"Well
It did drop a bit today ! This China sale is up in the air. One day is good news the next day it’s bad news. Do we really depend that much on China for the nvda  sales?"
2025-08-12,Just having the high end Nvidia chips isnt enough for the CCP to replicate.  The chip making machines TSMC uses are from the Netherlands and cost in the tens of billions.  If China ever gets ahold of the right foundry machines it‘ll definitely be a global game changer.  The sheer number of AI chips needed to build these next generation super computers are in the hundreds of thousands as you might have read that would further hinder Chinese replication and manufacturing.
2025-08-12,"ohhh  i see. That is great info, thank you

As tempted as I am, I know I am in no position to invest. There is too much to know. I have to force myself to just stick to ETF's. But it is just so tempting.

I made this mistake in the early 2000s, traded when I had no business doing it. Cannot afford that again ha"
2025-08-11,"Most people don’t grasp just how significant this announcement is.

This involves 15% of revenue from China — not profit — for both Nvidia and AMD.

It also signals that the Trump Administration is now negotiating “trade deals” on a company-by-company basis.

The trade war has just entered a new phase."
2025-08-11,I’m really curious how this will play out tomorrow. I can see this going either way. I have a large cash position ready to deploy so it dropping 2-4% I’ll definitely be buying.
2025-08-11,"I hope it crashes
I need to buy the dip"
2025-08-11,"this is good, bribe and appease trump and he will make regulations favour big tech. Jensen is brilliant, rather than the Tesla playbook which is call trump a pedo which resulted in EV credits getting taken away"

2025-08-11,so... is this *also* priced in?
2025-08-11,So is it a national security risk to sell advanced semiconductors to China or not?
2025-08-12,"All AMD and Nvidia have to do is increase the prices for H20 and MI309 by 15%. China have no options but pay 15% more. Win win for AMD, Nvidia, and Trump"
2025-08-12,If you guys believe this then I have a bridge to sell you.... they are not giving up 15% of revenue to the country lol.
2025-08-11,That’s nothing! Breaking $185 by 8/13. All in on Nvda!
2025-08-11,"Can the 15% revenue from all the companies just go towards the Medicare and Medicaid fund.

2025-08-13,"Idk, I wanna hate it, but at least it's publicly stated to (nominally) go to the public. That hes being open about it instead of just asking Nvidia to throw him a plaque (and 5% under the table) is a pretty good sign by the standards of this government.

It’s an oligarchy. At least communism leaves ownership with the state, and elites will fight over control of the state.

With oligarchy, they already won, they have the wealth and assets, they print the money and make the planet labor for it, only to aid them in accruing more assets. And there’s no way for any state to get the wealth back. It’s long gone. Game over.

That they share 15% of their foreign sales in exchange for an export license. 

ITATR license is a flat fee if the concern is that the chips can be used in military applications and they should be regulated as such the mechanism for applying for and obtaining an export license already exists and it does not require a Communist style revenue sharing agreement with the federal government.

I will also add that under ITAR a sale of something to a foreign adversary that has the potential for use in military applications would never be granted an export license.

This approach minimizes the price increase for individual customers, ensuring that the impact of the price hike is less noticeable. that is the best way to minimize a loss in business due to higher prices. If they only raise prices for Chinese sales, the increases would have to be more significant in order to counteract the loss of revenue, potentially driving away customers, harming their business further"

2025-08-10,"When a stock has run up this much, this fast (over 110% in four months), a lot of future good news is already priced in. Traders who bought ahead of earnings to ride the hype may sell after results, locking in profits regardless of how good the numbers are. If earnings don’t trigger an even bigger rally, market makers may sell stock to unwind hedges, which puts short-term downward pressure on the price.  This is why some monster pre-earnings runs end with a flat or red candle on earnings day, despite great fundamentals. Wall Street will scrutinize forward guidance even more than the actual Q2 results. If revenue or margin guidance is in line rather than above consensus, that can be interpreted as “slowing momentum.” Funds may use NVDA’s strength as a source of cash to rotate into other sectors or undervalued names. I've seen this happen late in a rally phase when a few mega-cap leaders dominate index gains. If there’s no surprise upside in the numbers or guidance, the “sell the news” effect could cause a 5–10% pullback. It wouldn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong with the company — just normal market digestion after a historic run."

2025-08-10,"Not for quite some time. Imagine, there will be new data (new research, user data, new world events) coming in, you need more data centers. And also don’t forget old data currently existing on paper, films, medical reports, old X-rays ( Cleveland clinic has tons and tons of this film ) and old news papers, all these need to be digitized and stored in data centers which requires new data centers. Long way to go baby !!"
2025-08-10,Bro companies dont even know how to leverage data centers for revenue yet. Itll decline when they stop innovating. If a company stops innovating theyll go bankrupt eventually .
2025-08-10,When somebody find something more profitable to throw money in.
2025-08-09,"Very hard to predict. I would say that Nvidia is in a really good position to dominate for the next 3-5 years at least. The other companies you mentioned will do very well too.  Also, Tesla unfortunately."
2025-08-09,Just don’t like Elon. Not just the Trump stuff…just seems like bad guy.  If he gets the robotaxi thing right it’s going to be a game changer though.
2025-08-10,Agree. I made $70K (was in under $100) and sold because he is a douchebag.
2025-08-10,“Seems like a bad guy” is not a legitimate reason to not like someone lol
2025-08-09,Lol ok I guess so. But do agree that robotaxi will massively disrupt the ride sharing industry once TSLA is able to scale. Hence my investment in them
2025-08-10,He won’t. Robotaxi is a joke compared to Waymo.
2025-08-10,Yeah. I will too. Waiting a little bit longer to see if they are going to meet their deadlines with the robotaxi rollout.  Elon tends to say things are coming faster than they are. I say this as someone who used to own a Tesla with “FSD”.
2025-08-10,"Nvidia is long term, that's it. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER."
2025-08-09,"NVDA is long term. It will double again within the next 7 years, but growth is going to slow down. I don't see a super cycle."
2025-08-09,"Things seem pretty positive for them. A) CapEx expenditures keep growing, and yet AMD earnings were lukewarm. That tells me NVDA is still the preferred chip provider. B) Their data center business keeps growing. C) They got their licenses to deliver to China approved. D) Blackwell delays cleared up, so earnings on these should show up. 
Forward guidance is critical to any big move up, but floor should be solid."
2025-08-10,The 10X bull run is done. It’ll continue to climb but at a slower pace..play the long game and you’ll be rewarded…
2025-08-09,every $40. a share it goes up its equal to 1 trillion market cap. seems crazy but true. so at 250 a share nvda would have a 7 trillion market cap. Mind Blown!
2025-08-09,"I don't own crypto but the discussions on Stable Coins and their use in US debt financing may end up transforming the world of digital finance.  The computing power necessary to do that is only possible on the back of NVDA.

That's just one example of the things that we have an inkling of what may be possible, but the solutions are waiting for the right person/opportunity to come along to figure it all out.  (Think Elon and SpaceX)

I look at NVDA as a pure play on the revolution of how people are beginning to look at problems by embracing a pure First Principles approach.  The power of AI is just in its infancy of allowing people to increase their productivity exponentially.  That approach will find solutions through simulations of optimal solutions which disrupt the world of business that has been stuck in its ""this is the way we always do it.""

NVDA isn’t just about “faster chips.” It’s about enabling a revolution of change in the way people think about the infrastructure of every existing industry.  Through the emergence of new industries, a revolution in the way problems are solved for not just business, but governments, society, and people in both the complex and simplest of terms will take NVDA into markets we haven't even thought possible."
2025-08-09,$200 is right around the corner
2025-08-09,It’s preferred for a pullback going up to earnings and than rip if it beats. More likely this thing goes up the more likely it’ll tank during earnings announcement
2025-08-09,"- 2025: $200
- 2026: $300"
2025-08-10,Nvda long term.  Still have a conviction for a $150 correction.  Don’t sell buy more.
2025-08-10,"I’m in more the long term as well. But waiting for a correction to buy more. It that doesn’t happen, it’s okay. I already have roughly 30 shares. 

Which isn’t a lot but more then zero. So I’m happy"
2025-08-10,Is it hitting $200 before earnings? And is it going to sustain that price range after earnings?
2025-08-09,Nvda gonna hit $1000 by 2030 easily! So get to 1000 shares before then and you’ll be chillin.
2025-08-10,Nothing negative comes to mind to stop this rocket. All signs are green.
2025-08-11,Looks like it's about to go back up first of this week. Maybe it dips some towards the end of the week and beginning of next week. Many people seem to be waking up to investing long-term. Nvidia is a winner.
2025-08-10,Different as in incredibly bullish? Ya.
2025-08-09,Nope. This is the normal NVDA pre-earnings run. P/E is higher than usual so I expect the normal pattern after earnings
2025-08-10,The growth will slow but generally will be much faster than this. Revenue is very hard to project but I’ve seen estimates of 3x or more in the next 3 years
2025-08-09,I don't know why people keep talking about China. Being able to sell chips to China was what pushed the stock price past $600 pre-split. When chips were restricted to China.... That's when Nvidia went sub $100 post split. This is just a restoring evaluation that was previously lost.... It's not a new catalyst...
2025-08-09,Yes feels like it now always rips into earnings and then we see what happens that day. It won’t pullback into earnings this time.
2025-08-11,We may see $150 very soon
2025-08-09,"“Yes, as of August 8, 2025, the U.S. has initiated licensing approvals enabling Nvidia to export H20 chips to China.”

Bullish all the way into and after earnings."
2025-08-09,old news
2025-08-09,"The article was out before the market closed, I don’t think it will be a major “catalyst” as it was mostly priced in and expected."
2025-08-09,"Exactly what I think, been waiting for a pull back to buy some calls lol"
2025-08-09,What is the normal pattern after earnings?
2025-08-10,"But without China they are overvalued, this removes (as long as it doesn’t get reversed) that concern. Then, if the follow thru is as robust as the announcements, other sovereign buyer’s revenues start coming through. 

But hey, I might be just delusional because I’m long……it happens."
2025-08-09,This is already priced in.... That announcement is what popped NVDA past $140 weeks ago.
2025-08-10,Was it priced in or was the volume low for Friday op expiring.
2025-08-10,Hell yeah they hit it once.  What’s another $1000
2025-08-10,"Deepseek brought it down about 30% from its top at the time. One fucking piece of news about some lame, supposedly cheap chinese AI model caused one of the sharpest sell-offs in the AI sector. Ask yourself. If it happened once, can it not happen again?"
2025-08-09,Waiting for a pullback too but been a while lol. Sold at 146 by covered call getting called :(
2025-08-10,I'm gonna give you a upvote due to the shared levels of hopium we have
2025-08-10,"I am long too, having been investigating NVDA since 1994... My point is... There is buying at the top prior to a correction and then there are buying opportunities.... 

This is not a buying opportunity.

And recycling previous catalysts.to make a Bull case isn't helpful.

What would be a Bull case is a pattern of major customers continuing to increase cap ex spending and NVDA being able to lower costs and increasing profit margin...while being able to maintain pricing power.

None of that other shit you mentioned is relevant if the volume of sales diminishes, manufacturing costs increase, and pricing power diminishes...

NVDA isn't a speculation stock that has its price based on the promises of new business and growth... It's already there... Now it's about profit growth."
2025-08-10,"Haha..

Good luck brother, I hope you hedge occasionally 😁"
2025-08-09,It's beautiful! I'm sitting at 633 shares at 39.13 and a little shy of 116k.
2025-08-09,No. You got lucky once but you would have gained much more if you kept buying
2025-08-09,Absolutely not you’re supposed to sell when you’re up 10% the ln Fomo back in at the top and panic sell for a loss
2025-08-09,"Same, but I also bought more right after it dropped from the 200’s down to the 150’s so I’m at $5.19"
2025-08-09,"Nvidia is about 10% (close to 200,000) of my retirement which follows the Russell 3000. I recently put 5 grand straight into this at 178. Want to do more. 

Before the new year I asked my friend who works at Goldman and he said it likely to half instead of double. 

No one knows. Better to have loved and lost…"
2025-08-10,"Damn straight you're doing it right. I would keep holding,  Nvidia going much higher."
2025-08-10,"Probably wish you bought more? I have 2,335 and @ 50&49 avg. I wish I had a lot more!!!  $426,995.97"
2025-08-10,Caution this thing can bounce around mine skyrocketed when i bought went down to a slight loss and started going up again. I bought a little more and the stock went crazy and split 10:1 . Don't despair if it goes below you buying price. Buy more it's on sale.
2025-08-09,Yea the 18 shares you bought an forgot about did well..

2025-08-12,Nothing since I bought it in 2017. Just buy and hold for  a long time.
2025-08-09,"Dad told me to buy some then, and I did."
2025-08-09,At least your minimal dividends don’t get taxed at15 percent 😭
2025-08-12,"Yeah your doing good, over time as the stock continues to rise or not, you should maybe take some profit periodically and maybe diversify a little here and there.  But here is the harsh reality at least in the case of NVIDIA for the last 10 years and more...

Had I not diversified, hindsight I would have over $1.6 million in NVDIA.  Was I wrong to diversify?  I don't think so.  I had no way to predict the future, and my diversification has done very well, with probably 90% winners, and 10% losers. But led than if I had left it all in.  Again, I had no crystal ball.  But as NVDIA continues to thrive you and I will continue to prosper... So, what happens if there is world conflict that spans Europe, Japan, China, and India?  Are there any guarantees?  What happens if a competitor finally finds a way to break into NVDIA's sphere?  Are there any guarantees?  The only $so far you and I have made is on stock valuation based on global orders and optimistic futures that are not guaranteed.  So this is my point about diversification and some profit taking.  I'm optimistic through March of next year and at that point I'll reassess, and many times sooner you can be sure of.  Good luck and maximum success to you 💰🥂"
2025-08-13,"Yeah I thought about selling half many times to diversify a bit. But instead, every dollar invested since 2017 has been into something different. So now this makes up about 10% of my portfolio and I've decided just to let it ride."
2025-08-13,"OK, that changes everything... Good plan"
2025-08-10,selling for 61.98 a share and buying for 66.25 a share. Is that a bad move? Thanks I really don’t know a lot about to be honest. lol looking to retire in 8 years
2025-08-10,"I’m not a financial advisor so do your own research but conventional wisdom says that If you’re that close to retirement you should be moving more into fixed income. You don’t want a market crash right as you need this money. Also, the price of something doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more expensive in this space. Something can be $1000/share but have 10 total shares = $10,000 value. Something else can be $10/share but have 100,000 total shares = $1,000,000 value. The price different between two types of ETFs isn’t fully relevant."
2025-08-09,Stocks go up or down for a lot of reasons other than news
2025-08-09,Whether Nvidia is exempt or not I still feel like once the news drops we will still see the effects of it. I say play it safe until the news drops and then go heavy. I think it stupid to make moves now even tho the news has not dropped
2025-08-09,"It's always like this with NVDA before earnings.  Nobody seems willing to commit one way or the other, so it generally moves sideways for a couple of weeks leading up to earnings.  Then it 8%.  Which direction is impossible to know."
2025-08-11,"idk what's wrong with people in pre-market:

\- 1) Trump just did this to Apple (increase of $100 billion to $600 billion total)

\- 2) Which cleared the way for Apple to build iPhone overseas in India (no tariffs)

\- 3) Apple's price surged 📈

**\*This is a sign of trust and future economic boom—a classic sign/easy tell—from DJT.\***"
2025-08-09,*nvidia is exempt from tariffs* “Tariffs!!!” “It doesn’t make sense to me” “am I missing some news?” “What am I not seeing?” Idk bro I read some Reddit news too idk why this research isn’t working. Conditions just aren’t following what I think will happen. Like why won’t the economy follow what I think will happen????
2025-08-08,I see your point but slightly disagree. Because not every competitor is exempt so it still does benefit NVIDIA in strengthening their already incredible position and making it harder for 2/3 major competitors to try and gain ground on them.
2025-08-08,"To elaborate on what the other guy said, Nvidia is a company charging a huge premium for the best product. If every other company costs the same huge premium, not because their product got better, but because there is an added tariff, Nvidia steals even more market shares."
2025-08-09,"With the companies that are now aware that they will not be paying a tariff investors are now looking harder at the numbers that the likes of TSMC reported and can take the information that they are manufacturing

 more chips in the upcoming quarter and equate that to mean that someone like Nvidia will be able to ship more supply. It is well known that the TSMC facility in Phoenix is running Blackwell chips and it is a fairly new plant."
2025-08-09,I sold 300 shares today at 183 and immediately put in a buy limit order at 175.  It has gone up and up and up for three months straight.  Something is going to trigger a sell-off and I have a feeling it will be earnings.
2025-08-09,"It won't be immune to the actual real-world impacts of them.  We've barely begun to see the impacts of these tariffs and (worse) confidence in the US dollar and bond markets.

I think the jobs report from last week is just the beginning of the bloodbath that is going to befall the economy.

But, as I posted this AM, I think NVDA is probably as immune the effects as any company can be.  The Google, Amazon, and Microsoft aren't going to stop building out AI and let someone else win the battle.  That should sustain NVDA throught the worst of it."
2025-08-09,idk how you do options with the current market. take a look at the way it traded yesterday even tho he exempted it and we all thought 185 by eod. max i can do in nvdl short trades.
2025-08-09,"I wouldn't recommend it on Nvidia unless you have at least 20k you are ready to lose. I would try some smaller stocks first until you get the hang of options. My personal favorites are AMC and Intel, they are pretty predictable ( bonus points if trump mentions them (it always goes bad for them if he does)) and you don't usually have to wait too long for your orders to be filed."
2025-08-09,"Here’s a breakdown of the main points from the Nvidia stock analysis video you shared:

Key Insights

1. Company Background and Growth:

Nvidia’s GPU technology is the core driver of AI and the most crucial tech in data centers.

It has had an incredible growth trajectory, initially targeting gamers and later benefiting from the crypto industry and the AI buildout.

The company has grown exponentially in recent years, doubling revenues from $61 billion to $130 billion, fueled by high demand for GPUs.



2. Financial Metrics:

Market Cap: $4.44 trillion.

Revenue: $148 billion.

PE Ratio: 58 (currently high but not extreme; forward PE ratio of 37).

Growth: Nvidia's free cash flow and margins have been growing at a rapid pace, despite some challenges like tariff issues and China sales restrictions.



3. Investment Analysis:

Nvidia is a strong buy according to analysts, with 36% increase in stock value year-to-date.

The company benefits from AI investments, hyperscalers' data center buildouts, and the eventual ability to sell products in China.

Some analysts believe the stock could reach $250 per share, but others suggest it may fall to $100 as the market corrects itself.



4. Cyclical Nature and Future Outlook:

Semiconductor cycles: Nvidia’s growth may slow in 2-2.5 years as demand stabilizes, with forecasts showing growth slowing to 16% from current levels.

Long-term, growth might contract, which could lead to a reality check for investors as growth expectations taper off.

The stock is currently 37% overpriced, based on cash flow analysis, and the market might be pricing it too high (55% above intrinsic value).



5. Valuation and Price Forecast:

Intrinsic value of Nvidia’s stock, based on cash flow and discounted at 8%, is closer to $2 trillion.

The stock is currently valued at $4.4 trillion in market cap, suggesting a significant premium.

The fair value of Nvidia’s stock may not justify its current price unless there are continued high growth rates.



6. Investor Sentiment:

Big-name institutional investors, like Chase Coleman, are major stakeholders, reflecting confidence in Nvidia’s long-term value.

Despite strong fundamentals, analysts remain divided about Nvidia’s future, highlighting the volatility of semiconductor stocks.




Summary

While Nvidia is a highly profitable and dominant company in the AI space, its stock price may be significantly overvalued in the short term. The market could see price corrections as growth slows in the coming years. However, strong institutional backing and a terrific product moat make it a compelling company for long-term investors willing to accept near-term volatility.

Let me know if you'd like more detailed insights on any specific aspect of the analysis!



The world of AI uses AI to talk about AI 🤔🤣"
2025-08-08,"Market cap is a function of profits. Present and future. Nvidia has a lot of customers for their chips and those customers have pledge to buy even more. If AI delivers on what everyone is expecting, those customers will end up buying A LOT more chips, other customers (entire countries) will probably join the race and for a number of years, Nvidia will swim in money. There are a few risks though:  
1. AI stops delivering. Both in terms of what the end user sees and in terms of what can be profitably integrated into applications and existing solutions. 

2. Nvidia stops delivering significant improvements with each generation, allowing competitors to catch up on HW performance (easier). But then they'll need to deliver massive SW improvements to allow existing CUDA software infrastructure to be migrated to their new platform."
2025-08-08,Revenue is only increasing. MSFT is largely increasing because of Nvidia hardware.
2025-08-08,"There’s a significant wealth transfer right now from scalers and  builders  to chipmakers. I mean, anything less than $80B capex per company seems to be underwhelming nowadays. The overwhelming majority of the cash going to NVDA., so yes…they are kinda undervalued still nowadays. I saw this coming in 2018 and did not have the conviction to go big as in “nahhh….way too many competent competitors like INTC”. Don’t be like me."
2025-08-08,Experts tell me to buy.
2025-08-09,"If PE ratios mattered to the stock price of fast growing companies, PLTR would still be in double digits."
2025-08-08,"P/E

Nvidia - 50

ARM - 188

Palantir - 720 

Relative to P/E is definitely overvalued but not extreme. The risk for Nvidia is competition. AMD could undercut them and force them to drop prices. Or Cerebras could take off. If they are forced to decrease the price by 30%, that would half the profit margins therefore push Nvidia down like a rock. One year ago I would have never imagined Nvidia close to 200 but markets are euphoric now (see Wallstreet cheatsheet)"
2025-08-08,"You know it reminds me of Japan right before the 1989 crash when the land value of the emperors palace was more than the entire state of California!

Yea, that didn't end well..."
2025-08-08,"You have to look what Nvidia has special... they have high bandwidth-low latency interconnect that they gained by integrating Mellanox. This actually makes them superior to AMD still because this allows 10GPUs to work as one more consistently. Software they have an advantage but it's nowhere near 5-10 years. Software advantage you can erased in one year with the right team. And I would not be surprised of Google/Amazon/Microsoft has already the software ready to be GPU agnostic.

The real Nvidia killer is Cerebras, because their wafer on a chip is way more efficient space, compute and power wise. If Nvidia is smart, they might just buy them and develop them further to offer Cerebras as ultimate AI solution. But, they would also need to buy Intel to have their own fabs. So right now Nvidia is in the position where they could secure their next 5-10 years, if they invest in the right stuff instead of doing buybacks. But from what I see they do stupid buyback just like Intel did in their glory years."
2025-08-08,"Took the numbers computed via the data from companiesmarketcap which I think are moving averages not last quarter data. In my opinion however, anything above 10 is overpriced, but the point is that there is room for crash."
2025-08-09,I bet your portfolio is full of stocks trading 8-10p/e growing -5% and paying 10% dividends because their own businesses are so cooked and bankrupt ready in less than decade
2025-08-09,"In case you are not up to date, there are successful efforts to port the CUDA APIs to AMD and Intel GPUs. The major players, like Google/Meta/Microsoft/Apple are all unhappy with the outrageous prices that Nvidia demands. And also unhappy with the technological monopoly of their interconnects. That's why they formed a consortium for standardizing high bandwidth interconnect. And when it comes to computing power, Nvidia does not have a special matrix multiplier that is way better than the one from AMD or Intel GPUs. Those are standardized libraries. The difference between Nvidia/AMD/Intel is how they organize those in clusters and how they feed them. And with slight finetunings, at the software level, you can get the same performance. And in the age of AI, one could take the full AMD API, full CUDA APIs and let the AI generate a translation layer in less than a hour. Not practical yet, but this is going to be the biggest usage of the AI. Once this is done, it's game over for the software layer."
2025-08-09,"Dear friend, I am not here to attack your favorite stock or make you sell. What is certain is that Nvidia is overpriced and it is bound for a hard correction somewhere in the future. If you do not understand why, let me clarify it for you: its margins are coming mostly from hardware, they have a single cash cow, unlike Microsoft/Apple that are well diversified. One can argue that Nvidia with its GPUs is doing what Apple did with their iPhones. It's a good analogy but not true. Why? Because when Apple came with their iPhone, they captured the Software ecosystem that allowed them to get recurring revenues with margins higher than the ones from the hardware. Nvidia is infrastructure. They can capture the hardware side and be the software provider for the software foundation (at least for a while) but they have 0 chance to capture the software products which will be the cash cow. Here, their competition is their clients. If you want good business you do not compete with your high paying clients. And the money is in the software, not in the hardware, reason for which you see now Palantir on the moon. Now, does it mean that Nvidia will crash at some point? I think it's certain. But can it go to 200-250$ before or even higher? I would say no, but one year ago I thought 150$ was hopium and I was proven wrong. So for the sake of your portofolio, I hope I am wrong again. I would suggest you to be smart and not greedy, learn when to take profits and do not be sentimental about one stock. 

As for me, I had an almost 100% gain between February and May this year when I followed a strict strategy and gave up on being sentimental on a stock."
2025-08-09,"wow what a real einstein , stocks will crash sometimes ? well oh really i wasnt aware of that. nvidia makes correction i will happily buy more just like i did start of the year."
2025-08-09,"""learn to take profits"" tf you dont even know whats in my porftolio , you have zero idea what percentage nvidia is even on my portfolio. LOL keep crying dude. i believe nvidia will truly change the world its the only company making these developments possible. truly apple of the AI industry. never selling quality companies."
2025-08-09,nvidia keeps beating the estimates and bears like you keep coping and crying. all mag7 companies raised CAPEX and that flows straight to nvidia. they will beat Q2 numbers big and estimates keep rising. 35x forward p/e for nvida is not expensive when you factor margins and competitive moat + advantages. bears always act smart and cry.
2025-08-09,"You seem to have something personal with my comments, so I will respond here to the aggregate of all 3. First, I will remark that you are very likely young and inexperienced to actually know how the casino works. You may look for the Wallstreet Cheatsheet. I recommend you that one. The market makers will fuel the momentum as much as they can, then when the time comes, when they know that the growth stagnates, they will pull the rug by start shorting, doing both normal shorting and naked shorting. If you look at SEC FTD data you will notice it. The show will go on as long as the big bulls do not switch camps to be big bears. You are very naive if you think the growth is 100% organic. It will come crashing down and never again have such a high price, that's because hardware is cyclical. You will buy the dips forever if you are not able to recognize the moment. And you will end up another cry baby that fills reddit. I mean it when I say, learn how the casino works and benefit by knowing how it works, not by going with the euphoric gamblers. And if you go with the euphoric gamblers, learn when to pull back and enjoy your profits. This will not last forever. And there are signs that the music will stop soon. Not here to say that everyone should sell or instill fear. I'm just saying that, if you hope that Nvidia will hit 1000$ you are then mistaken. The euphoria might continue to 200$ or beyond. However... I would be very careful once I see S&P 500 to 6660 or beyond."
2025-08-09,I think you should learn to invest and find quality companies im up on nvidia ridiculous amount
2025-08-10,"Eps down, revenues-50% past5yrs. Yes i see they are doomed"
2025-08-08,"Same. Just started buying, a week ago…40 shares currently. Not looking to become a millionaire. Just hoping to pay my hoyse off and buy a new truck at retirement. Not selling anything until April 2035. Hopefully a couple/few splits and up in price again. Fucked off most of my life and just started investing at 53."
2025-08-08,"You’ll be grateful that you did! Nobody is even talking about more than a few other trillion dollar industries they serve. 
The foundational software and networking solutions are killing it. Robotics and basically everything that moves requires the Software Jetson coupled with their gpus. Will be in every single one of them! I had made a great score post split and was going to take a bunch out when it hit $150 and if it hit it was but a few minutes so I never sold a share and hotdiggity dog I glad I did not! Once my Nvidia is over 2 million I’m sailing off on me fancy boats 😎"
2025-08-08,"Buy high, sell low"
2025-08-08,"This is the more realistic retail investor and I wish more people like you posted

Hoping this pans out for you buddy"
2025-08-07,No problem trimming/taking a profit. Hopefully that wasn’t your entire holding?
2025-08-07,"To buy what, a slow cooker?"
2025-08-08,"Nvidia isn’t just a hold it’s a money printing machine. I fully expect it to blow past $300 well before 2027. This isn’t the time to sell, not now, and not anytime in the next decade!"
2025-08-07,Sold calls at $183.50 - definitely have room for a pullback & reentry through earnings.
2025-08-08,I bought Nvidia a few years back because I like video games. 700% is not bad for being a nerd... lol
2025-08-07,Price ain’t coming down bro you should have held lol
2025-08-08,“I expect the price to come down a good bit soon though” - famous last words
2025-08-07,It will run up to earnings. Look how AMD is now. Won't sell any shares until 250
2025-08-08,You don’t go broke taking a profit
2025-08-08,Nvidia is easily marching past $200. I’m holding my 200 share position for the long term. We are just in the beginning stages of AI. I will keep adding. Congrats on your 150% gain though!
2025-08-10,I’m just here for the dividends 🍿🥤
2025-08-07,Bro you should have held the earnings at the end of the month will catapult the price above $200
2025-08-08,"I have 30 shares left avg. $12, I sold a bunch early, not making that mistake agaim"
2025-08-08,Whos selling? Not me
2025-08-07,Good trading brotha✊🏾
2025-08-08,"Can you share why you think it will dip in price?

thanks"
2025-08-08,I got 100 shares at 108$ but this is my next 10 years. I wonder where this is going to go.
2025-08-08,Why sell now? Dental emergency? This thing ain’t coming down. Hold this for as long as you can. It’s a once in a lifetime stock.
2025-08-08,"it's going to be tough for the price to come down tbh, when everyone is relying on AI so heavily nowadays, especially in the tech sector"
2025-08-10,I’m at a 61k % gain here. Gonna be more once it blows past $200.
2025-08-07,At least wait until after earnings man. Three more weeks.
2025-08-08,If I do go in today I think I’ll buy a few contracts at like 175 and 177.5 and have them expire a few months out. Build somewhat of a cushion for the market to react to good or bad news
2025-08-08,"Great job, taking profit is always the right thing to do.."
2025-08-08,Thanks for the shares!
2025-08-08,"So you slow-cooked a 150% gain in one of the strongest stocks of the decade… and your big brain move is to jump out and hope you can time a dip? Bold strategy, Cotton.

Nvidia’s been on a rocket and you’re over here trying to outsmart gravity with vibes and guesswork. You do realize trying to sell high and buy back lower is the exact move that leaves most people buying back higher, right?"
2025-08-09,Nice profit taking.
2025-08-09,"Dammn son..

I have 52 shares at a $62 average and am up a lil over $6,000 right now, 195%. However I don't see it going down that much any time soon, if anything I think it will keep shooting up. I'm curious how high it could actually go, this is my biggest holding and would be crazy if it hit like $200 or $300.

NVDA to the moon."
2025-08-08,why would anyone sell nvidia?
2025-08-08,He might’ve needed the $ now though
2025-08-08,"No, but sold MOST of it. Kept a couple shares"
2025-08-14,"Seriously, I'm working towards my first 100 shares!"
2025-08-08,I sold mine at 181 and just did a buy in
2025-08-09,"If I may, what are you buying \*now\* bc you like video games? Ask bc I don't play but I want the gamers insights"
2025-08-08,"That’s what everyone said when it hit $150 back in January. Could go up, could go down, no one knows. Up is more likely though."
2025-08-07,Nah I think he made a smart choice for today. We gotta see what bullshit spews out of Trumps mouth next week on these semiconductor tariffs.
2025-08-09,I’m going to buy tmr I think
2025-08-08,"Tbh, although AI is absolutely popping off right now and incredibly popular, with most likely little slowdown in sight, I’m a simple retard trader. My belief is, that it’s just a bit overbought right now, there will be a little bit of a down trend soon, the stock is too hot. I’ll buy back in with more equity hopefully at around $140-160 per share within the next couple months. And then it’s back to smooth sailing onward and upward to 250 and beyond. I just try to buy low sell high. I just think it’s in a good spot right now to sell high."
2025-08-08,"Quantum has entered the Chat. 
Brought his friend, Annealing."
2025-08-10,"Cause it's volatile, many people made fortune selling near highs and buying back at major pullback."
2025-08-08,"Good for you OP, did the same thing recently with a $16 basis"
2025-08-07,Aw man. I got in at $96 and it’s going to break $200 very very soon. Already passed $180….
2025-08-08,You still made fantastic profit but I’m holding my shares long term it’s just that type of stock.
2025-08-07,"He did say they were exempt from the tarrifs, but I don't know if I can trust that. Some bull will come down and screw us"
2025-08-08,i am a total noob and this thing has a strong buy from 89% of analysts even at this price but its hard to know whom to take seriously.
2025-08-08,I hope so I’m holding long term
2025-08-07,It's a good strategy until it's not... Everyone is a genius when the market is going up. Maybe buy some other stocks to balance out your portfolio.
2025-08-07,Prob better luck buying today because of GPT-5 and selling by EOD or EOW. But I’ll prob carry my NVDG for a while like I did with PLTU
2025-08-07,"Honestly it’s not that bad of an idea. I’d recommend a stop loss of around 5-7 percent tho, you will probably have to manage it frequently due to the volatility to both sides. Just manage your risk. If you need more safety and still want the 2x stocks, consider multiple stocks such as also holding for example AMDL 2x AMD or things alike. Personally you should try ad more capital/ cash to the account overtime and more towards normal stocks as time and your portfolio grows. 🙂"
2025-08-07,I have tqqq (450$)
2025-08-07,"Nvidia has gone from $1 trillion mc to $4.3 trillion mc in just over 24 months and AI as a global infrastructure is still in its infancy. I think you can probably throw out any rule book when it comes to market caps, heading into uncharted territory from now until 2035."
2025-08-07,"That would make it a $14.7 trillion dollar company.  


Slow down cowboy"
2025-08-07,"I'm super bullish when it comes to nvidia. 
I also think Dan Ives is an idiot."
2025-08-07,You know what? Fuck it. NVDA AT 3 MILLION A SHARE END KF 2026 PRICE TARGET
2025-08-07,Are his targets even legal? 😆
2025-08-07,Dan Ives is beyond bullish for AI. He’s delusional
2025-08-08,Honestly if it breaks $200 they should do a 5:1 split lol
2025-08-07,2030 750$
2025-08-08,I said this before and I will stand by my prediction. NVDA will fall between 500-800/ share by 2030. Barring no major WW or crazy world changing event
2025-08-07,So this means a ~$15T evaluation?
2025-08-07,Dan Ives is the GOAT of AI investing  advice
2025-08-08,"not bullish enough, but it's a start"
2025-08-09,I say Nvidia Price Target $69.00. Checkmate. What u gonna do now?
2025-08-19,You are posting some presplit old news
2025-08-07,Will split at 200. To keep it low so people can buy.
2025-08-08,"Until China invades or blockades Taiwan, then it’s plunging like a rock along with every other semi stock (and possibly the global economy)"
2025-08-08,"This is what I’m leaning on.

I kept NOT buying amazon because it was too expensive back when it was young.  P/E too high… blah blah blah.  I could see the potential, but i let my traditional thinking get in the way so year after year I kept passing.

Not gonna happen this time. I’m holding at LEAST 10-20 years, AI is literally in its infancy."
2025-08-07,"With crazy inflation it could reach that. 

At that point a base model 2045 KIA will be around $175,000 and everyone will rave about how it’s a smokin deal."
2025-08-07,"Yeah, while I’m a big PLTR shareholder (5k) he’s been kinda crazy when it comes to predictions—especially PLTR."
2025-08-08,Dan Ives / Wedbush. Bullish on everything. Nice guy. Questionable fashion choice tho. You wouldn’t loose him the dark
2025-08-08,"I like to think about what Warren Buffett said,when a stock comes in or down to the price i want to pay,be sure to take a big enough bite,if I knew 10 years ago what I know now, hind sight is always 20 20"
2025-08-10,"I did the same thing on Amazon. Finally bought 25 shares @$996.20 on 6/21/2017, now split x 20=500 shares. Basis of $24,904.25 is now worth $111,345. Time and patience pay off. It’s paid for everything I’ve ever bought on Amazon and more. 😉"
2025-08-07,"Check out the froth surrounding PLTR.   Give NVDA some froth and 600 is not out of the question.   I'd definitely keep my head on a swivel for rough times though.



Query to Gemini:

Based on recent market data, here is a comparison of the current P/E ratios for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR):
 * NVIDIA (NVDA): The P/E ratio is approximately 56.77.
 * Palantir (PLTR): The P/E ratio is approximately 669.42.
This shows that Palantir's P/E ratio is significantly higher than NVIDIA's, indicating that investors are willing to pay a much higher price for each dollar of Palantir's earnings."
2025-08-07,Oh wow he is a true genius then. Got nothing to do with the insane bull market we had for 15 years
2025-08-08,"Lolol NVDA’s recent rise genuinely does **not** have to do much with the last 15 yrs of “insane bull market” returns. Have you tried ChatGPT?

I’d urge you to graph the derivatives of NVDA’s stock price vs. that of the QQQ/SPY — you’ll see:

- 12-15 yrs ago NVDA was extremely underperforming, and

- 0-3 yrs ago NVDA was extremely over-performing"

2025-08-07,"Cost basis is for the most part a stupid measure. If you're an active and profitable trader, most of your holdings cost basis will be close to current price. I currently hold 100 NVDA @ $130 that I have committed to sell but I have also committed to buy 400 shares"
2025-08-07,I currently hold 527 shares of Nvidia and 887 shares of Palantir!  Hoping like hell both stocks continue on their upward climb!!!!

2025-08-07,Good on u sir
2025-08-07,I hate myself everyday for not investing in nvdia once I graduated highschool. I didn’t learn about stocks and retirement until my mid 20s
2025-08-07,"You turned $100k into $176k. Consider that a big win! But yeah, I never sell it all at once."
2025-08-07,Why sell all?.... thats why you'll never make money
2025-08-07,Selling calls?
2025-08-07,"That's us.  My husband saw it, he was a big gamer (has slowed down a bit since then as he got older LOL), we invested in 2004 & 2008 - have sold and donated all the 2004 shares, but are still holding the 2008.  Our cost basis is 25 cents after splits. (I'm not sure what it was before the splits the shares went through)"
2025-08-07,"Don't hate yourself. Investing is FULL of missed opportunities, you can't get them all."
2025-08-07,"That’s life! Even though my 2120 shares @ $9 is great, I’m 64 yo. I started investing in 1985 into my 401K, started “playing” in investments prior to dot com bubble and lost plenty of real money and on paper money. Got back on track until 2008 and investments went down 50% - fucking brutal. But bought Apple in 2010 😃! Then Covid hits - we didn’t panic, but investments down big again. Had money on the side so I picked up Nvidia. My IRA, wife’s IRA and other investments now worth about $6M. I say all this because we didn’t make all this overnight or on Nvidia and Apple - most through 401K and a long time in the market! Good luck"
2025-08-08,"As many have said here, don’t feel bad - there will be many more opportunities for you - you are in the game now."
2025-08-10,"Don't hate yourself, better late than never, you are doing good"
2025-08-07,"I’m sorry but you have decades of investing left where I know people who  I can’t convince to start. until their late thirties 

You could’ve save 100k before they ever started. 

You’re doing good. Just age alone."
2025-08-07,"yea i was getting uncomfortable having all that money in one stock, having it all in SPY can still get me good returns, and I had debt to pay."

2025-08-07,"Tbh I feel like in every aspect of monetary life (housing, stocks) I am born too late + were a poor university student too long. While everyone in my friend group swims in money without having done nearly as much for their position in life then I did."
2025-08-08,"That’s the plan! I’ll never sell my palantir, nvdia, or rocket lab shares."
2025-08-07,"I’ve already surpassed $100k net worth, but I could’ve been a millionaire by now if I invested before covid in the companies I hold stock in now. As to the people who are almost 40 and haven’t invested, that’s totally on them and not school systems."
2025-08-07,Scared money doesn't make money....
2025-08-07,I wouldn't call selling and asset a good investment.  You hold for 20 years.
2025-08-07,He sold at 176 and tonight its 180 and will be 250 in a year and a half. Thats called missing out on potential profit.
2025-08-07,"It only seems that way because you can see the outcome of missed opportunities with favorable outcomes. But you don't count yourself lucky everyday for NOT investing in that random biotech company that went to $0 where you would've lost it all. 

Everyone looks at NVDA for example and says ""If only I invested every penny I had in NVDA, I'd be living on an island right now..."" But the thing is you wouldn't have ever done that. How do I know? Because you didn't! 

You take on risk that's tolerable for you. We make decisions (usually) based on risk, possible outcomes, and what we think is best for us at the time. There's no use dwelling on the outcomes AFTER the fact because you're essentially making the decision with perfect hindsight lol of course I'd only pick winners if I could, we all would!

You can however use the outcomes (positive and negative) as lessons and maybe adjust your risk tolerance. Maybe you risk a little more on that biotech company, not everything you own, but maybe a little more than $0. Maybe you become rich beyond your wildest dreams. Maybe you lose it all. 

Maybe you just buy VOO, live within your means, manage your debt responsibly, don't compare yourself to other people around you, and live a great comfortable life knowing you're better off than most of the people around you, and most people who have ever lived before you."
2025-08-09,"Bro, the audacity is crazy ngl. I have a 90% stake in NVDA and I'm in long but I would never criticize someone for taking profit. He might need the money now or has fears of a potential recession. He can invest and take profit how he wants. It's insane you feel entitled to tell him otherwise"
2025-08-07,dang $14 a share? when were you buying?? I thought I was cool when I bought at $43..
2025-08-07,"You realise all of NVDAs competitors are also excluded? Is this how thick most NVDA investors are, they can’t even read past the part they want to see?"
2025-08-07,Earnings are end of August. I see it hitting $200 then.
2025-08-07,Great news everyone 🤜🤛 onward and upwards.
2025-08-10,Getting somewhat stretched at 58 times earnings?
2025-08-07,"I want to stab myself in the heart for not buying more when it dipped into the eighties. I believed in it enough to hold, but I wish I had believed in it more"
2025-08-07,I think my first shares were $43.40 (actually $434 because it was before the split). I remember hesitating because I thought I was too late 😅
2025-08-07,But I've bought all along also. I didn't buy all my shares at 140.
2025-08-07,Started buying at $140 presplit. So there was a 10 to 1 split and if we didn't split we'd be at $1700 a share or so now
2025-08-07,217 mid sept. along with pltr.
2025-08-07,Hey man I sold at $150 expecting a correction lol

2025-08-11,"I’m pretty sure NVDA is past that stage caring about fundamentals, we’re pretty much in “ now show us the earnings” stage,!

Still holding and would take any dip as an opportunity to add, but future growth and earnings matter."
2025-08-11,Wouldn’t be holding it if I thought otherwise.
2025-08-11,"What I did when NVIDIA dropped and not wanting to add more, I started a new position in Lam research, and added to my FSELX ( its biggest holding is NVDA at 26%)

This way you’re still participating buying the dip and diversifying at same time."
2025-08-11,All companies will continue to grow and especially the megacaps. Nobody knows which ones will outperform in 10 years. Thats why its better to just buy vgt or qqq etfs
2025-08-07,"Buy NVDA, they have been pushing production facilities in USA, TSMC aswell. They will be exempt as is apple"
2025-08-09,Most of NVDA chips are not sold in the US and not subject to tariffs. Most of NVDA revenue is not the cost of manufacturing chips and not subject to tariffs
2025-08-07,"Alright, and what percentage of Nvidia's revenue do the Taiwan-made chips represent ?"
2025-08-07,"Just responding on the revenue, which to date all comes from Taiwan made nvidia chips."
2025-08-07,"Right, but if I understand what Trump said, as long as companies like Nvidia have some kind of manufacturing in the US, they'll be exempted on overseas-made products... Right?"
2025-08-07,...and here I thought I was finally going to buy at a cheap price...-\_-
2025-08-07,"TSMC will build factories in US.
Chill guys LMAO"
2025-08-07,The devil is in the details. And so far no details. Need to know how much needs to be invested in the US to be exempt. Obviously Apple had already pledged 500B so in his meeting with Tim he told him to up it another 100B and he did. He may request different thresholds for different companies also 🤷🏻‍♂️

2025-08-07,"For reference, you need a 17% drop from $180 to get back to $150. That’s not happening any time soon. Every time there’s a small dip, it immediately rebounds back to ATH."

2025-08-08,"Oh yeah, it was like this the first term. This time I can profit from it."
2025-08-07,Their profits are absolutely insane. This years profits will be like 2x Ford's entire market cap (90B)
2025-08-07,"I think the bull case is basically that AI is the primary achievement of human civilization. If you believe this, then there is probably no ceiling."
2025-08-07,"Looking at a different perspective: Bitcoin market is roughly 50% of Nvidia, without any material asset. People invest in potentials."
2025-08-07,"The most dominant company in a new fast growing industry that is described by CEOs of some of the largest companies in history as the most important technological revolution in history. They're insanely profitable and growing fast with multiple future S curves on the horizon. Led by a founder who has proven to be extremely smart, stable, diplomatic, with strong ties to the two most powerful countries on earth. They're earning insane amounts of money and generating insane free cash flow while being supply contrained. A true platform in the previously described industry.

There's a reason they are worth as much as those stats. Their profit margins and future growth indicate that they will earn as much as those entire industries/companies. Their valuation is rich but by no means crazy. It's basically justified by their earnings and free cash flow growth along with consensus expectations. 

I have slight geopolitical concern but other than that or some other unknowable black swan event (both of which would tank the market in general anyway), this is as much of a sure thing as I've ever seen."
2025-08-07,"I first got into the stock because I'm a PC gamer and bought exclusively Nvidia cards. Been gaming for most of my life and I figured years ago to buy up the stock. 

I know the gaming side of Nvidia doesn't make as much money, but I knew their other sides of the business have been great wealth generators."
2025-08-07,"Multiple companies have planned to build 1T spend for a super computer by 2030. Conservatively NVDA should be able to reach 600B in revenue. Depending on the p/e ratio the market decides to give NVDA, should be a 6 to 8T market cap pretty easily"
2025-08-07,"Well First, listening to Jensen and his vision just amazes me. I also own an RTX 5080, which helps me with gaming, rendering, and other computer work, and it being the most valuable company is also another good add-on. 😉"

2025-08-07,"Strong growth. Limited downside risk (IMO). Large Moat. Biggest contributor to a revolution (AI) that humanity has ever seen. Technically a difficult field to compete in. Full stack so vendor lock in. Cross techno-space dependencies (and no; not like Cisco) 

There are a lot of reasons I invest in NVDA, as opposed to say Palantir or Tesla. I see them as potentially amazing stock but extremely high risk from multiple vectors. They could sky rocket but somewhat easily be snuffed out. 

NVDA has multiple protection layers - for a few years anyhow."
2025-08-07,I invested many years ago when it was around $3 per share.  A good friend told me to invest and I did.  I don't regret it since now I have over $300k in Nvidia and it will keep climbing.
2025-08-07,"Because at the current 4.3T market cap do you think “this is the ceiling for Nividia” “they can’t AT ALL grow their business anymore” when they currently have a block with selling to China (one of the largest consumers of their chips) / AI and data centers (if they continue to grow have only just started imagine where and what will be needed to run AI infrastructure/ data centers in the years to come let alone let’s say still years away by 2030) / gaming/PC industry continues to explode year after year I just don’t see any world even with a downturn and slow in growth at some point that Nividia doesn’t hit 5T potentially even 6Trillion market cap and who knows maybe that’s even low balling…

also I think people have realized/fully believe in the future with CEO Jensen which further brings in consumer confidence on the retail side of the stock"
2025-08-07,"This is one of my favorite reasons:

2025-08-07,2 chicks at the same time. That’s why. 😎 But seriously this is like investing in milk just after they figured how to pasteurize it.

2025-08-07,"I got in somewhat late to Nvidia, I bought 57 shares earlier this year when the market tanked due to the tariff announcement/AI restrictions, but when it comes to this stock, or any for that matter, I like to look at it like a supply line. 

The world is embracing AI/AR, companies are flocking to use it, who creates the chip that basically empowers AI? Nvidia. Almost the entire world either knowingly or unknowingly uses Nvidia in some shape or form because they supply so many of the AI chips"
2025-08-07,Gee I never looked at it that way it must be over heated I’m selling
2025-08-07,"Same reason I invest in Palantir, I love their CEO"
2025-08-07,"He is sell you a story while he sells his shares man, yes they are good but he is a salesman and the only person worse is musk"
2025-08-07,"That’s not a reason to invest since it is expensive to buy, if you just want profits why not buy the most profile company, Google"
2025-08-07,"They do a heck of a lot more than GPUS Bud! They have pole positions in multiple trillion dollar industries. Robotics will be worth more than data centers!

This is unprecedented and impossible to call a top on something that has never been done before? Dot.com was built on credit that didn’t exist. Nvidia has its buyers paying cash! UGE DIFFERENCE"

2025-08-07,He has over 850 million shares of NVDA. I’m not too concerned about him selling a few shares every now and then.
2025-08-07,"Dude, this guy doesn’t care a bit about money. All his sales have been predetermined for his trust. He keeps getting them because he’s producing so much. If he doesn’t sell them he will lose them! Take the blinders off and try and see a bigger picture that a photo id"
2025-08-07,There is something called a growth rate. Googles profit growth is like 1/4th of NVDAs
2025-08-07,Just stop making excuses and buy Nvidia and get rid of the monkey on your back
2025-08-07,"I think back then, people in the know could kind of see it coming and conceptualize what was going to happen (I lived through it). One thing that is different this time is that nobody knows what the impact is really going to be because we are dealing with an area of science that is not well understood. We don't actually know what intelligence is, even though we can come up with any number of examples of it. It is precisely the emergent properties of these models which we find to be the most useful and each new use or application (even by any regular Joe playing with ChatGPT) is actually a new scientific discovery. I think this is not really appreciated by most people, and the magnitude of this paradigm shift probably can't be overstated. 

That said, if there isn't a bull case, the future will be dystopic as fuck. The alternatives to a bull case are dire imo."
2025-08-07,Bitcoin makes for a terrible currency because it's too unstable. Anyone investing in Bitcoin is just hoping the value goes higher. A deflationary currency can also be crippling for an economy. So I just realistically can't see how it can be a real replacement currency.
2025-08-07,"Yeah that’s just bollocks, of course he cares about money. He will not loss them if he doesn’t sell them"
2025-08-07,Lmao why would I buy the expensive stock that’s already ran up when AMD has a much higher reward to risk
2025-08-07,"It's already a currency. 

There are so many currencies in this world. Just because usd or chinese yuan is big, does not mean you should disregard other countries currency. 

The world needs a decentralized currency anyways. The more chaos and un-united the world gets, the more valuable is bitcoin, the more unstable it is. It's not meant to be stable."
2025-08-07,"What if i told you core inflation of 3% is false,  because its peg to your country currency and is also in control by your gov. 

What if a decentralized core inflation could actually be 80%?

Your cost of living lets say groceries price is getting higher but what if the cost of these groceries should be lower due to advancement of technology? Does that mean the fiat currencies has devalued so much to the point you are facing inflationary cost of groceries?"

2025-08-06,"Hey OP and friends, you may be unaware that AMD’s sequential data center revenue decline is primarily driven by U.S. export restrictions on MI308 to China, causing write-downs ($800m this quarter and last) and a shipment slowdown. This hit coincides with a transition to new MI350/MI400 GPUs, creating a temporary dip before new product volume takes effect. Competitive pressure from Nvidia and cloud providers’ custom chips adds further headwinds limiting data center growth momentum. However, AMD raised its revenue guidance for Q3, projecting $8.7 billion ± $300 million. 

While data‑center revenue was hit short term by export restrictions, the company expects new AI accelerators (MI350/MI400) and strong processor demand to fuel recovery and overall growth in Q3."
2025-08-06,Buy more AMD if you are a long term investor!
2025-08-06,After all the hype recently it was a meme stock all along?

2025-08-06,"All the coaping in this thread lmao. This is the golden time of data centers where the number of data center investments and players is increasing rapidly due to the potential being 'unlimited'. Everyone just wants to invest & get centers operational ASAP. Yet AMD can't grow its sales. Maybe there is a comeback story coming at some point but this graph is Intel-level embarrassing, there is no excuse. The data centre valuation is no there and I don't understand why the market is not understanding that."
2025-08-06,Would you be a buyer of 2nd rate chips unproven just to save a few bucks out of billions? I think not kimusabbi

2025-08-06,You won’t need to minus the charge from nvidias upcoming earnings and it will be up.
2025-08-06,"I understand this is an Nvidia-focused sub, so naturally some may view any mention of competition as a slight. But my response is simply addressing OP’s question about AMD’s two revenue drops last quarter.

As for product placement and competitive positioning. It’s hard to answer that definitively. Ultimately, client decisions vary based on their sensitivity to price, performance needs, project timelines, and long-term goals."
2025-08-06,"And it’s more expensive stock to buy, what’s your point"
2025-08-06,"Nvidia revenue won’t be able to continue at such a high growth rates at its mc, I would rather put my money towards a lower mc with potential to gain share that’s just my opinion."
2025-08-08,"Yes, owned it for a few years at the $90 range. Missed it by thaaat much was a phrase used far too often. They are worth a shot. There is plenty of room and they make quality products. Just left a bad taste so I found Palantir at $12.00. That’s doing Nividia things."
2025-08-06,"Sounds like Chat GPT authored that second paragraph.

Didn't view it as a slight.   But I do think there is a lot of rationalizing that happens with AMD shareholders at times.  This is probably the most competitive AMD has ever been, but data center rev is declining and Nvidia just made good on their 30x performance promise.  The road ahead for AMD DC GPUs just got harder."
2025-08-07,"Oh, back I 2015 I bought both and AMD could never crack a hundo ? They made a big acquisition for a FPGA company and they were going to take Nvidia’s lunch…I sold out soon after! It seemed like a good idea own the top and bottom of that space Intel was flailing missing every cycle of the chip size evolution. AMD is a poor excuse for 2nd place"
2025-08-06,"When AMD is getting the price premium NVDA gets relative to earnings and growth(slightly higher premium in fact), it surely shouldn’t, but here we are."
2025-08-06,"Redditors complain all the time about megacaps dominating and getting bigger and bigger and swallowing everything in it’s path.

But when it comes to investing “nah man it just can’t happen. Wait wtf. What happened. It’s gotta be a bubble surely.”"
2025-08-06,Amd marketcap already has a couple years of exponential dc growth priced in (even relative to nvidia) and they are not taking off.
2025-08-06,"Nvidia will definitely get bigger I’m not saying they won’t, I’m saying there’s more growth potential in amd but caution due to higher risk and lower market share. The market is currently in a bubble for sure, how can u say record high pe and gdp growth relative to market value are at record highs isn’t a concern, inflation is only going to rise to an even higher value if rate cuts occur, aswell the us will have to print to pay off their debt, jobs numbers are horrible, service numbers were dead flat, tarrif related costs etc. I can understand why people invest at these times but I wanna see how it plays out personally."
2025-08-06,"How can you say specifically amds stock
Price is the only one priced in for future gains? Look at the entire stock market rn, the S and p is trading at its highest pe since the crash and market value to gdp is at 200%. Look at pltr trading at 680 plus pe. I do believe that amds valuation is a little high but most company’s atm are trading at high valuations, today’s market was a decent buy for most but I’ll be waiting further"
2025-08-06,Because some other stocks are irrationally priced amd is fine? Good logic!
2025-08-06,"When did I mention or imply amds valuation is fine? I just said I wasent buying it. I cants stand when people say “ it’s price is already priced in” how can you even predict or measure its price and if it’s priced into x amount of years? I don’t think there’s any reasoning or actually any thesis, I think your a Nvidia bull who can’t stand anything else but them. If you could please explain how you measured that its price rn is priced in future years and it won’t grow, if that was the case every single company rn won’t grow as there all “priced in already” please do your homework before throwing random words at people without thesis"

2025-08-06,"It’s the “unknown” tariffs on chips coming in “a week or so” whenever the hell that is. It’s gonna be  bumpy till then and possibly dip much more on the day or the reveal of this mysterious tariff. So you just wait for that opportunity, hope it happens, and buy more coz you know right after it some resolution will be announced and it will pump back up in one or two sessions. That’s how things have been happening EVERY SINGLE TIME and this time won’t be different except that the dip might not be that significant coz now EVERYONE KNOWS that that’s what’s been happening! A resolution will follow shortly after. He will announce that he greatly decreased them or cancelled them since a deal was made to invest in building some chip factory somewhere on us soil by tsmc or something and chalk it up to another win."

2025-08-06,"Selling premium seems to have gained a lot of popularity.  Especially “wheel” strategies.  The reason?  It’s a simple strategy that any lame duck influencer can talk about and seem like they know what they are doing.  

You should take real time to learn about options and learn about why traders use certain strategies.  The good news is Tasty Trades has a plethora of information and training.  There are a lot of hidden risks that unless you understand option pricing and derivatives you really could lose a lot more then you realized.

Fyi selling options (premium) is undefined risk, high probability, low reward strategy.  You are locking in consistent profits which lowers your overall portfolio beta.  You can expect to match or get close to the performance (return on investment) of the S&P 500 but with a lower beta (variation of your portfolio returns - risk).  This will give you a portfolio with higher alpha than the S&P 500.  

People get very frustrated when after months of work selling premium they are still only matching the underlying’s performance at best don’t understand the point is lowering the variation of returns.  In other words you are smoothing out your returns."

In the last 3 months I've seen you all make bank every time trump announces something. There were of course the exceptions of those that sold at 85 but, well, I'd rather not comment on that. 

I expected everyone to be happy to potentially make bank once more and yet all I see is people fighting over politics. Is this an Nvidia reddit or a us politics reddit? And why are people complaining if historically you all made money? 

It's like watching 2 very religious people fighting over which god provides their water in the desert instead of just being glad they got water anyway."

# Trump says new semiconductor tariff plan coming as soon as next week

***Published Tue, Aug 5 2025 8:42 AM EDT***

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will unveil new tariffs on semiconductors and chips as soon as next week. “We’re going to be announcing on semiconductors and chips, which is a separate category, because we want them made in the United States,” Trump said during a lengthy interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

Trump said that announcement will come “within the next week or so.” He did not provide other details about the plan. Global demand for semiconductors and microchips has skyrocketed as the technology has become integrated in virtually all sectors of the economy, including the booming artificial intelligence industry.

The vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan, home of major chipmaker **TSMC**, whose customers include **Apple**, **Nvidia**, **Qualcomm** and **AMD**.

Trump revealed the new semiconductor tariffs just days after he signed an executive order to impose new U.S. duties on a slew of countries’ imports, with some trading partners facing steep hikes. Taiwanese goods are set to face an updated tariff of 20% starting this week, though that is down from the 32% duty Trump had previously threatened as part of his April 2 “liberation day” levies."
2025-08-06,Must be wait for the tariff announcement sell off and buy the dip time
2025-08-06,Hes manipulating the markets !  Hes smart!  Buy the dip!
2025-08-06,"Remember in April when he said it was a good time to invest? He was right. Listen to him and after the drop if he says the same thing, buy."
2025-08-06,May I please borrow some money to buy more NVDA?
2025-08-07,"Just a ploy & an excuse, the markets have to reset in September as they always do just re-buy around 137"
2025-08-07,Damn I’m buying a new cpu and you today then
2025-08-07,The tariffs don’t apply to semiconductor products or anything A/I related quid pro quo’s of building factories and assembly plants removes them completely! He’s said that many times maybe today you HEARD IT AGAIN. At the press conference with Timmy
2025-08-08,"All the majors are building in the USA, including NVDA and TSMC…no tariffs on NVDA chips! That was announced on 8/6. Your article is from 8/5. $181.60 is the price of NVDA, 7:00PM Eastern time on 8/7. The dip is in the future, when you would be lucky to get it at $181!"
2025-08-10,"Nvidia is an America n company, they manufacture in the United States, but not in China. They do sell in China, but they do not manufacturing China. They also manufacture in a couple other countries which will probably not be tariffed too badly."
2025-08-05,"These comments are proof any retard with some money can invest. 

Fucking cry babies. 


Never looking beyond the curtain. Must suck to live so faithfully.

The biggest economic shit show was Covid, not tariffs.

Deal with your loss, snowflakes."
2025-08-05,Time to short it
2025-08-05,Yep. It was good way too long.
2025-08-06,"Whatever. If it dips enough just buy more. Moving chips manufacturing to the states will take years and the ai race would be lost. That’s not gonna happen. Soon as the companies “agree to build some factory” over the next decade, he will exempt them from tariffs and that’s that. Meanwhile they will continue manufacturing as usual. Take the dip as a sale and hope the sale is good enough coz it’s gonna bounce right back up no matter how low it gets."
2025-08-05,"I love all the TDS.  Nvidia has done great under Trump like the rest of the market and our economy.  It's going to be a great year for investors.  Thank you President Trump, keep up the good work."
2025-08-06,Shit. This guy is really out to destroy profits for general people. I bet his friends are all benefiting from these statements.
2025-08-05,😂 good one
2025-08-05,That’s how I’m seeing it. Also a chance to roll my 150 covered calls if it gets that low
2025-08-05,Buy on dip. And show us the Epstein list!
2025-08-05,"More so I think investors don’t care much. Chips are too instrumental to the AI race that it still won’t slow sales much. It’s not like these are retail buyers purchasing chips; these are companies, with outsized capex dry powder."
2025-08-09,"Not at all. The market value of stocks should reflect their value based on their sales, future projections, business plan, etc., not the aberrational arbitrary whims of a psychotic despot. Taking advantage of market swings based on the despot's irrational actions is smart, but it's not ideal, because once you own stock you don't want its value to be deflated for reasons that have nothing to do with its value based on real business  considerations."
2025-08-06,"Has it ever occurred to you that it is beyond the power of Trump and any president for that matter to force manufacturing to come back to the US? Least of all worth his brute force methods?

Semiconductors are something Taiwan and China for that matter are really good at and we are not, Trump's actions will only drive up costs for Americans. 

We should be focusing on things we are good at that we have an edge on such as large tech (that makes use of Taiwanese and Chinese chips), military hardware, planes, energy, etc."
2025-08-06,"What is short sighted is the US consumer who wanted ‘cheap goods’ over domestic manufacturing the past many decades. Individually you all thought it was great, but collectively you watched manufacturing disappear.

You go tell Americans to choose what is collectively good instead of what is good for them individually. Good luck!"
2025-08-06,"You know absolute 0 about semiconductor manufacturing.  

This isn’t an industry you can bring back to America by waving a tariff wand.  Creating semiconductors requires people with the expertise and highly specialized equipment.  It would take years and years to get this up and running.  And in the meantime?  

The US falls behind and eats shit via tariffs increasing costs.  

The way to bring this sort of manufacturing isn’t by applying tariffs alone.  It’s by creating incentives to actually manufacture here.  But the  🥭monkey is too inept to pull this off."
2025-08-06,What would you buy into?
2025-08-05,What’s behind the curtain? What is the grand plan here? I don’t invest to make losses. Maybe you are so brilliant you do.
2025-08-06,Keep drinking the koolaid buddy.  Once the markets over react he will just pull the tariffs back as he always does 🌮
2025-08-06,"As if what's been going on is normal.

Another Trump cult member whitewashing this Bullshit"
2025-08-05,And his sycophantic cult members whitewash that Bullshit
2025-08-05,"The market has barely gotten past the point it was at when  he was sworn in. And it started it's quick decline not long thereafter, until the straight up crash."
2025-08-06,"Their growth would have most likely been better, without all the Trump tariff bullshit."
2025-08-05,Another Trump sycophant cult member whitewashing this Bullshit.
2025-08-05,Hope it does so we can put this whole tariff crapfest behind us. I'm tired boss....
2025-08-05,"Exactly. The race is on and they are willing to invest billions to be in first place. Having 10% tariff wont change their interest. Might cause a small dip anyway, which im glad to buy for the 10th time. 


Still sad to know that this is a complete manipulation to the market and how is the president of america allowed to keep doing it"
2025-08-05,"Sell now. Buy when it drops. Nvidia falling is a good thing. It's going to go back up. And if youre holding and this is a concern, you might as well get out of stock trading."
2025-08-06,No. Literally the main economic reason for tariffs is so that imported goods are more expensive than domestic. So consumers buy domestic. This may lead to more domestic manufacturing of goods. Part of the point of tariffs
2025-08-06,"Youre referring to the past decade(s) of democrat administrations, and youre right. Fixing that gigantic mess isnt the flip of a switch, and takes effort, time and investing in ourselves as a nation."
2025-08-06,That's 1 way of looking at it i guess.  Not factually of course but it's a way.  As for me my portfolio is up a little better than 40% for the year.  To me that is a great returns for the year and I still have 5 more months to improve on it.  But hey yoy should invest in the way that best fits your situation.
2025-08-06,How's that? I hope he and anyone else associated with Epstein go to prison for a long time.
2025-08-05,Buy the dip and shut the fuck up...
2025-08-07,10/17. No plan. Let them get called away and stop thinking about how much money I could’ve made. Rolling is too expensive at this point given that $180 is the new floor. Slim chance we have another black swan event to drop the stock 17% from its current price.
2025-08-06,they've all been doing it. You're just targeting this one
2025-08-06,That only works if the goods can be produced domestically and the domestic goods are competitive with non domestic.
2025-08-05,"We'll know if the republicans didn't block the UNREDACTED Epstein file. And if there are democrats in that file, toss them in jail together with Trump. I'd fully support that. Whoever it may be."
2025-08-07,"Then why is it that it's always these good, christian, republicans that are found to like raping children"
2025-08-06,"I’m ready to buy NVDA at $100.  
Daddy Trump, make NVDA cheap again. 
🥭🥭🥭🥭🥭🥭🥭"
2025-08-06,"No, not specifically that 1% drop, but it is a documented fact that both democrats and republicans manipulate the stock market, both in order to help themselves buy when favorable, and to sell when favorable."
2025-08-07,Gotcha. Good luck
2025-08-07,"They all pick winners and losers. Yes. But blanket tariffs have been dead for centuries, its a new level of self destructive economic policy. Youd think americans would fight the largest tax increase in decades across every product they buy, but just pretending that China pays their own tariffs is enough for people i guess."
2025-08-06,Sure thing.  At the closing January 19th the S&P was at 5997 with rounding and the dow was 43488. At the time of this post the S&P is at 6300 and Dow 44125.  So if all you did was just sit on index funds you're doing ok. But more importantly the day before Trump was elected the S&P closed at 5713 and the Dow was at 41794.  So since we the people and the market knew Trump was steering the ship the market has continued to improve and the outlook for the rest of the year is for it to continue improving.  If I'm wrong and he's so bad you should be betting against the market so you can make all that money being right.  But you're betting on things to keep getting better because even though your politics say NO you wallet is knows the answer is YES Trump is right.  Have a nice day.
2025-08-06,The day before he was elected is irrelevant. We the people know what a Shitshow Trump has been steering. And the chickens will be coming home to roost by the end of the year because of his Tarriff Bullshit.
2025-08-05,We won't have bad numbers much longer. It will all be faked good numbers to please trump
2025-08-05,Why do we care? We long 🚀
2025-08-05,"Better question , how will trump will react if the déficit numbers are bad ?"
2025-08-06,"Deficit went down. Exports also went down. This is bad for the USA. Trade deficit widened with Vietnam, Taiwan, and India. Look for the government to target these nations with trade barriers in the near future

This report supports fear of a contracting US economy"
2025-08-07,I think October is when we start seeing buying power decrease as a first impact from the tariffs but it might not be that bad. Americans love consuming and being in debt 🤷🏻‍♂️
2025-08-05,Why would you be thinking that the trade deficit numbers would be bad? Things have moved along quite quickly with many countries already.
2025-08-05,The trade numbers are good.
2025-08-05,"We've been faking numbers for decades. We did it by changing what we were measuring not just blatantly falsifying them so we were ""good"" and they were ""bad""."
2025-08-05,Good point
2025-08-05,"Yeah, that’s why he fired the BLS director. She didn’t give him good numbers. No wait, she showed positive numbers three months before the election, Harris still got Trumped. She showed great numbers in May and June. Keeping Powell from lowering interest rates then the July numbers sucked and then revised May and June down 250,000 jobs. There are 2,500 federal employees at the BLS and they couldn’t figure out accurate numbers. You think that 💩wasn’t politically motivated? Here’s your sign!"
2025-08-05,"You care because everything affects everything else.  Slowing economy, lower GDP, job losses add up… meaning less $$$ to buy chips and just general slowdown in corporate spend.  NVDA stock price cannot withstand a slow quarter  in its rocket growth, even if it’s just short term.  So susceptible to even the perception of a recession."
2025-08-05,They're already out. And they're good
2025-08-05,"Yes, they are. So should be pretty smooth sailing into earnings on the 27th"
2025-08-05,"Im curious about that too. Russia and China have been able to fake shit for decades. 

I guess so long as im making fat NVDA stacks im happy. I already got my dual citizenship and built my little empire in another country"
2025-08-05,"I give it Six months.  Real people are feeling the pain of increased costs of groceries and everything now.  Wait until these latest tariffs “adjustments” kick in after the product backlog runs out.  When Walmart starts raising prices across the board, stuff is going to collapse."
2025-08-05,"You dont seem to understand how the system works.

The numbers are based off of what is reported to them, the revisions are based off of additional data that is reported."
2025-08-05,It seems that nobody in Washington is good at Mathing? The fed uses an incomplete formula to calculate the rate. Seems that they don’t include any of the money they print each month??? I think that might be an important for accurate data interpretation…what do I know
2025-08-05,True you did.  But why would you the numbers could be bad?
2025-08-05,"Yeah, I'm going to be very careful after the earnings report runup
 Once the costs of the Tarriff really start kicking on, in the US, things can go sideways very quick"
2025-08-06,If the Federal Reserve is basing interest rates off of those numbers then stop guessing and wait for the revised numbers only. Taking a SWAG at numbers isn’t a very good way to do business. SWAG Scientific Wild Ass Guess.

2025-08-06,Aug 27th earnings call
2025-08-05,If you didn’t sell in April you have recovered all and then some. I am 80% NVDA 20%cash. My account was down $120k in April. I have recovered all and am currently $110k higher than when the bear market started in April. 2500 shares at $136 Cost basis.
2025-08-05,I mean yeah I know but I swear this dude will do anything that goes against economic prosperity. Like it doesn’t come out till next week and you purposely decide to do this on AMD earnings. Like come on the American ppl aren’t that stupid. So many days in the week to release this news and he chose today. That is intentional
2025-08-05,I was over leveraged so had to take a L truthfully wouldn’t have ever imagined it went to 88 I had 700 shares at 108 and it toasted me for 4k
2025-08-06,"Ouch. That’s why I don’t do anything but hold a large investment in good companies. As an example I bought 4,000 shares of Walmart right after it split in February last year. Six months later sold it and made $62k. Then bought Nvidia with that profit. But I’ve seen those six figure drops twice. First with Amazon then this year with Nvidia. Took Amazon 8 months to return to a profit but Nvidia did it in three."
2025-08-05,For sure. Only good thing is these stocks are resilient so it’ll go up and then some so imma just wait till the news drops and buy the dip
2025-08-05,"What is way more interesting and will show this year is the actual net profit per quarter. That will equally grow with revenue because Nvidia has a limit and spending. At some point it makes no sense to spend more in staff, in R&D and in buildings. So what happens is a rise of cash pile. Nvidia has $50b in cash today. This pile will probably be $100b or more by the end of the year. It will grow another $100-150b next year.

At some point, Nvidia will have no choice but to return more to shareholders or they keep the cash and get interest for it which would be a bit strange.

Their run rate for net profit is at 50-60%. They increase revenue at \~$5b QoQ at the moment.

That means in the next 5 years, Nvidia will earn almost $2 trillion in revenue at current trajectories or $1 trillion in cash though net profit % will probably rise because operational costs will not rise as much as revenue will.

To give you an interesting comparison. Nvidia has $50b in cash and with 4% could make $2b in interest from that cash. AMD had a net income of $1.6b in 2024. If AMD doubles their net income and Nvidia doubles their cash then Nvidia will earn more money from interests than AMD does from all of their operations. And people wonder why Nvidia has 20x higher market cap.

This year, Nvidia might surpass Apple in net profit. In 2-3 years maybe even in revenue. And even Apple will now use money to invest more into AI which will benefit Nvidia in the end one way or the other.

What many don't seem to understand, Nvidia doesn't need for their customers to make profits with AI. Nvidia is selling AI compute and currently the world needs AI compute primarily for R&D and even that Nvidia can't fulfill and continues to be supply constraint."
2025-08-05,"Ask yourself when the exponential growth is over and when it's going into logarithmic stage, where net profits are declining.

Chips cannot be expensive forever."
2025-08-06,Selling chips for free would make margins worse? I dont get that statement

2025-08-06,"Did you sell your NVDA before he said this? Do you own any?

Until the actual tariffs are announced it's just a headline. NVDA may not be part of it at all, as they are already moving a great deal of manufacturing to the US, now that TSMC's AZ plant is going and another being built. It might just be companies that are not in process of moving production to the US. 

So, pertaining to your thread... you were just bashing Trump. Which is why you're back continuing to spew nonsense. You had zero point about NVDA and were just looking for attention. That's not what r/nividiastock is for.

I know you think you were insightful based on what he said on CNBC, but if you didn't sell your shares first, what good is your insight? If you do own NVDA, you're spiking the football on yourself... since you're down along with everyone else holding it. But I doubt you actually own any, not counting a holding in a mutual fund/etf."

2025-08-05,191 by Friday. 211 after earnings call
2025-08-05,"I have to laugh at the Non-Stop ever flowing banter about Nvidia stock! Oh it's going to drop oh it's going to increase, should I hold, should I sell, it's going to tank, blah blah blah.

If you want to see the most inexperienced and unknowledgable bodies in the stock market it's easy to see them on full display in all of these threads and posts! When you cut through the senseless uneducated banter what you'll find is that Nvidia is still in its infancy and regardless of ups and downs, those who are not stockpiling Nvidia stock now, will be labeled as complete NVIDIOTS 2 years from now plus.  SO AGAIN for the lightweights and amateurs, Nvidia is not a stock you trade it's a stock that you own and HOLD!!

I've made over $2 million dollars off Nvidia in the last 14 months because I have continued to accumulate positions and not panic in fear. Yes it is still worth loading up on it now because you can bet without a doubt it will be over $300 per share by the end of 2026 if not sooner. Have a nice day"
2025-08-05,"Maybe 191 by Friday. NVDA tends to drop a few days before earnings, recover some in the AH after earnings, drop heavily on opening, and then drop slowly for a week or two (or a month). You'll have to wait at least 3 months from now to see 211"

2025-08-05,Yeah I think we are due for fireworks. People forget that even with the huge market cap this stock is still incredibly volatile and is capable of climbing to a totally unrealistic valuation rather quickly if the bid/ask is suddenly dominated by bids
2025-08-05,Holding NVDL now is a no brainer
2025-08-08,"Dude holding that is like hold naked calls.  When it is straight up it’s wonderful, on sideways action and a pull back you get wrecked.  Buy a zebra or shares.  Write calls on the shares for some protection through earnings."
2025-08-04,"I wouldn't load the boat, because usually it drops after earnings, but DCA'ing in is safe. 

Other considerations for not loading the boat right now, and why a lot of people/institutions will take profits: China is a big reason the share price is holding, but Nvidia is being investigated by China as to whether or not there's a back door on H20 GPUs. It adds uncertainty. Historically the stock is up a few weeks to a month before earnings, and sells off, even thought the past year hasn't risen this much before earnings. Blackwell isn't new news anymore, and it will be a while before the ""Ultra"" variant releases, and even further out before the Rubin architecture releases. The share price has more than doubled this year from the bottom, and of course the P/E ratio has nearly doubled. A lot of people don't have any concerns for the P/E ratio nor market cap as a tool when assessing a stock, but institutions do, and institutions own the majority of Nvidia shares. If the price goes up even moderately institutions will take profits on earnings, buy the dip, and do it all over again. I'm personally not uncertain about Nvidia, even though it will always be volatile in nature, but a lot of the market is, and that equals more volatility. The share price has been unusually stable lately. Nvidia is priced for perfection, and institutions and shareholders are always expecting the mother of all blowout earnings beats, or else they take profits. 

If you're long term, DCA in. Dust will settle from this earnings before November earnings. If you're investing a lot, that's more reason to DCA in. If you're using margin and aren't diversified, that's even more of a reason to DCA in. If you're short term, I honestly wouldn't suggest buying Nvidia this close to an earnings report, but instead waiting for the dust to settle afterward after a few red days or weeks (way too many green days lately). Sell offs are way more frequent than upswings after an Nvidia ER, regardless if they beat earnings estimates or not. In the past the share price would rise high enough before earnings to get into the 90s, but not this close to earnings (it's had it's run up for this quarter), and there's a lot more uncertainty about things right now, because of the investigation, recent all time highs, the PE, market cap, no new hardware releasing soon, and our current administration isn't very predictable. 

The only thing I'm aware of that Nvidia has going for them in the short term is China, but we need to wait for the ""all clear"" from the investigation. If everything's fine, November earnings will reflect additional GPU sales to China, but that will make earnings projections even harder to beat and satisfy the masses. This month's earnings shouldn't have any revenue increase from China. If they do, it would be minimal.

In short, I wouldn't, but depending on your finances, risk tolerance, and holding period, it may still be fine for you. In the end, the current share price is not the new support, and with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, the share price will certainly go below the current price before November earnings."

2025-08-04,"Yes buy. I think its due for a real pullback maybe this week imo. Buuut, its NVDA so im keeping my calls. 
I think we will see a climb to around 180 or so again, then rejection. By earnings week the bearish sentiment will be gone.

Things that I worry about: China massing very large numbers of troops and Taiwan once again raising the invasion alarm. Trumps cold war moves against BRICS to include openly talking about our subs being off Russias coast (they have always been there, but for him to openly say the N word is a big deal). Finally Tariffs, Russia is going to get smacked with them, but other foreign leaders will fold like the rest have. Idc its its a 15% tariff compared to the old 30% its a win for the U.S."

2025-08-04,"No, I guess maybe put in a little if  your holding for over 3 years but if that were me I’d wait till a big pullback, that goes for most of the stocks right now"
2025-08-04,"I think people have high expectations for that earnings reports, so it’s kind of already priced in. Anything short of being blown away will lead to a drop imho, even if the earnings are very good"
2025-08-05,"You should do what yoy think is right.  You earned the money spend it how you see fit.  For myself, I've bought, I've taken profits and ive bought more over time.  I buy shares at levels I believe they are a good deal.  Like last Friday, no I'm not buying 100k at a pop or some wild amount like that.  I spend what I have to lose and nothing more.  Nvidia has strong fundamentals and long term it's been and will continue to be an incredible opportunity for regular folks to make great returns.  However if the volatility of the stock is to much look at fidelity and their semiconductor MF.  That one might be a good move for you also."
2025-08-05,"Yes, then sell it afterwards. That’s the pattern."
2025-08-05,I would not do anything special. The expectations are sky high so even a blowout ER would just be what’s is already priced in. Just ride it out.

2025-08-05,"Nvidia has denied the H20 chips for the Chinese market having back door.  I would assume Nvidia could easily prove its statement as true.  Then the sale of H20 to China would be certain.  The stock price of Nvidia dipped after earnings reports, but not for the last one, which dispelled doubts of technical issues in production and the slowdown of orders from hyperscalers.   Orders for various types of chips have almost been sold out up to 2026.  I anticipate the stock price will continue to climb post earnings."

2025-08-04,"There's no rush happening, I think it's better to buy it before the earnings"
2025-08-05,"Since April 21st there's been a consistent climb in the market as a whole. Because of the uncertainty with Tarrifs during the first ER this year (Feb 27) NVidia (along with the rest of the market) wasn't able to climb like they would've from the first quarter of Blackwell shipments. The resulting share price from that earnings was still waiting for the market to recover, with roughly $8 Billion more in Blackwell revenue than Colette originally let on to a reporter in Jan would be on the Feb ER. There was good runway for NVidia to resume once pressure lifted off of the market a bit, especially after such a draw down. I could be wrong, but I believe what we're seeing is synergistic of both, Feb and May earnings during a total market recovery after a pretty major draw down, and I just want to be sure the OP is aware of the goings on, and err on the side of caution. 

The main thing I was trying to address about China shipments wasn't solely about the investigation, but to make sure the OP understood no shipments have gone out, yet. The reason I pressed on the matter so much is because in October last year when Blackwell was first reported to be sold out beyond 12 months, and then confirmed shipments wouldn't reach some customers until the end of calendar 2025, many people didn't realize that even though there was great news about Blackwell being backlogged so far out, there weren't going to be any Blackwell shipments on the November 2024 ER. There were quite a few people last year that didn't expect their cash to be in a bind. I just didn't want anyone to go all in again under the wrong impression.

Hopefully what Beth Kindig has been saying for the past year is right, and that not only May, but August earnings would be ""fireworks""."
2025-08-04,"I'm not certain. In January, Colette answered the question of one of the reporters when they asked her and Jensen how much revenue was expected from Blackwell architecture for the February earnings report, since that earnings report would reflect the first quarter of Blackwell architecture shipments. She said over $3 billion. I could tell she was sandbagging a little bit, because they can't give specifics out legally before an ER, but the result was actually $11 billion. The stock still declined. 

Now, of course everything declined around that time. The thing is, even with that $11 billion, and even though the pre-existing architecture still grew in revenue alongside it, it still didn't beat expectations ""enough"" to satisfy the market, or to be considered a blowout earnings. So, with at least 8 billion more than what anyone really had a heads up for, and that not resulting in a positive manner, I would imagine now that $5 billion is even less of a percentage increase that could be displayed on the earnings report, and it's well below the unexpected $8 billion from the February 27 ER, my opinion would be that it is priced in. This makes me think this would have to be a major blowout quarter in order to maintain the current share price, but of course the stock market is unpredictable. It's just extremely risky to try to nail down whether or not to purchase Nvidia around an earnings report, depending on the nature of the investor (long-term, short-term etc.)."
2025-08-06,"The tariff stuff is kind of over my head, to be honest. Trump has stated such a wide range of percentage possibilities. 

In my humble opinion, at least for the big players in the US, like Google, Microsoft, Meta etc., I don't think it will reduce how much product they're going to purchase per quarter/year, even if it increases their yearly Capex a little bit. I think they're profiting really well off of Nvidia hardware, and they're all in major competition with one another over all of this. I remember Beth Kindig saying this was a situation of ""survival"" for these companies. That whoever ""gets there first"" could greatly impact the competing companies. It's a race, and I think they're all going to continue paying whatever they have to in order to stay competitive. They've all come too far, and spent too many hundreds of billions of dollars to give up at this point, I believe.

In June of last year there was an article reporting that Nvidia claims that the return on investment for every $1 spent on their hardware is between $5-$7. I know they've made larger claims than that elsewhere, but this may be a more realistic expectation. If that's true, and if the big players really are making 500-700% ROI, I don't think tariffs will impact Nvidia that much. We could of course see some supply chain issues, but I'm hoping not.

Also, the ROI ""could"" increase further for architectures on more advanced nodes from TSMC, like Nvidia's Rubin architecture. You may already know, but Rubin is supposed to start production soon, and should be on the ground/shipping in 2026. I'm just not sure when in 2026, and of course they'll have to work out any normal development issues along the way. Be ready for the media to have a field day while they work out the kinks, again. The media exaggerate every single kink being worked out before it ships. So, more fun ahead with Nvidia volatility! 

Tariffs may impact sales more to other countries, not because they're the only people Tariffs apply to, but because they may not have ""Google money"". As far as large US cloud service providers, if Nvidia were solely to sell to the big cloud providers here in America, I think they would still be sold out. I could be wrong, but either way I don't think they're going to have a problem staying sold out. I think the problem meeting demand will continue, tariffs or not.

I think with how much Trump is supporting Nvidia, and because Nvidia is not only the largest company in the country, but in the world, I'm hoping Trump will try to keep things smooth. The better Nvidia does, the better Trump looks, and I think Trump likes to look good. We'll just have to see how it all plays out.

Take all of this with a grain of salt. I do have pretty strong opinions about all of this. It's just my perspective. Anything could happen, and anything could drastically change."
2025-08-07,If anything a positive mild catalyst. Trump is insuring their freedom from tariffs. Along the supply chain.
2025-08-04,"Pure long term fundamentals combined with short term speculation on AI technology. That means there will be several chances to profit on the upside and on the downside. Of course NVDA. as a big part of market indices, is also subjected to the whims of the market’s direction which is independent of the company’s performance. 

“Annual revenue growth of 140% over the past two years was outstanding, reflecting market share gains this cycle

Share buybacks catapulted its annual earnings per share growth to 80.2%, which outperformed its revenue gains over the last five years

Strong free cash flow margin of 48.8% enables it to reinvest or return capital consistently, and its recently improved profitability means it has even more resources to invest or distribute”"
2025-08-04,Ive been buying and will continue to do so bc in the long run nvda is going to makes its holders rich. 174$ per share will look like pocket change within a year from now.

Card updates are seen to provide a lower value to the consumer and higher profit to Nvidia. They also try to manipulate coverage of their cards by not allowing popular but sometimes critical reviewers from accessing their cards upon release. There’s a general sentiment in the PC enthusiast community that the company is abandoning the customers that helped build them into the company they are today.

With that said, if AGI is discovered then I am pretty sure the tech company (not Nvidia) that discovered it would pump quite a bit, yes. If you want to bet on this I guess you should turn to companies like OpenAI, xAI, Google, Meta, and so on."

2025-08-04,"Tbh, I think a law suit or a doj investigation is going to come up with Nvidia. 

I am a huge bull for Nvidia, I own a large portion as well.

The reasons why I suspect this is:

1. Controlling the AI Chip Market: Nvidia owns most of the AI chip market (70-95%)

2. Forcing Product Bundles: Nvidia may require customers to buy its software or networking gear along with its chips, locking them into Nvidia’s products and limiting their choices.

3. Buying Run:AI: Nvidia’s purchase of a company called Run:AI could help it control more of the AI market, reducing the need for other companies’ chips and worrying regulators.

4. Acting Like an AI Gatekeeper: Nvidia’s control over AI chips lets it decide who gets access to key technology, which could be seen as unfairly shaping the AI industry and drawing regulatory attention.

5. Facing Global Scrutiny: Other countries, like the EU and China, are already investigating Nvidia for similar issues, which could push the DOJ to act to prevent Nvidia from dominating the AI and chip markets.


Google is going through the same issues, Nvidia will continue to grow, and I dont doubt it'll be a double-digit trillion dollar company, but there is a lot of hype(well deserved) around it. I have a feeling, and that is just my own opinion that something will come down the pipe, which will crash the price prob by 20 to 40 percent."

2025-08-04,"It's a software achievement that will maintain the demand for more GPUs, but if each company purchasing Nvidia GPUs simply increases capex by 26% per year, that will double their Capex within three years. They (Google etc) can't maintain that very long, especially the companies that are already spending around $100 billion a year. They won't necessarily hit an absolute wall, because they'll be making profit, but I don't think it's realistic to think singular companies will be spending half a trillion to $1 trillion a year on capex alone (not anytime soon). Then there's the question of how many hundreds of billions (or trillions) of dollars worth of product can TSMC supply on a yearly basis for Nvidia alone, when they also have Apple, AMD, and many other companies to manufacture for."

2025-08-03,"Thanks for posting something with substance behind it. 

My understanding is that results from the channel indicate that the ramp rate for Blackwell racks is ahead of consensus, and they have higher margins, meaning earnings should be higher in August and October than consensus. (It’s a little confusing that you use calendar quarters rather than Nvidia’s fiscal quarters). 

The lost and regained revenue from China is hard to calculate because it’s not clear when it will be bookable again and by how much. Also it will be lower margin. But it is still good for Nvidia obviously that this revenue will come back. 

I’m pretty sure that the steady rise in price of nvda over the past few months has been based on the news from the channel, so this is largely priced in at this point."

2025-08-02,"Why would I sell if it when I know a year from now it'll be higher,  bozo?"
2025-08-02,Because a lot of people assume that its gonna keep falling to $0....
2025-08-02,Grandmother left me $150 mil.... turned it into $265 mil thanks....
2025-08-01,Don't panic and buy the dips imo
2025-08-01,"Capex spending... 

• Microsoft: $120B (expected $80B)
• Amazon: $118B (expected $105B)
• Meta: $100B (expected $72B)
• Google: $85B (expected $75B)

Happens every time it goes down a little."
2025-08-02,"its hilarious how people call $173 on NVDA a ""dip""

got a good laugh at that"
2025-08-02,Buy. Then hold. Then buy again
2025-08-01,Good for my NVD that’s been kicking my ass since I bought it can’t wait to edit the stratify so I can join this rocket.
2025-08-01,The market is going to suck now from the mess these assholes made with all of the government firings and the effect of that is just starting to come to fruition. Job reports will be in the toilet for some time. He is a fucking c**t. So tired of it.
2025-08-01,wait for open market and see how it reacts
2025-08-01,I plan to buy but people here say there may be more of a correction 🤷‍♂️
2025-08-02,Everyone panic while I buy more.
2025-08-02,"Good, I bought 8 shares today at like 2pm and made like $2 by close. 😎"

2025-08-04,"What’s insane is it’s very shorted, than look at the prices of some of the far OTM calls vs more reasonable ones; its been shorted but now all the far OTM calls are worth a fortune, why??? I think we rally Monday / Tuesday to $190 than back to $180’s where I beleive it’ll stay"
2025-08-04,Is anyone else holding a long call at $180 strike expiring 8/8?

We know you’re dying to do it, and we are dying to find out how it’ll turn out."
2025-08-01,I was telling everyone here that there was a $20m put on TSM out till September but I got downvoted. So yea.
2025-08-01,Sell it…
2025-08-02,Buy the dip.
2025-08-02,Definitely sell if you can.
2025-08-01,Time to sell
2025-08-02,"Yeah...I guess. Depending on how invested you are in it.

There may be other AI stocks that produce better returns over the next 18 months(AMD for one)... 

But if you only have a couple hundred... sure. I'd wait as this could get a little bumpy and it wouldn't shock me to see NVDA dump another 10-12%...which could get you in around 150, but.. nobody knows how stubborn Trump is going to be or if he'll just TACO out again."
2025-08-02,And buy amazon today
2025-08-01,"Buy low, sell high. I like it. "
2025-08-02,"All AI stocks will. 

Just look at his portfolio.

Amazon, NVDA, AVGO, are his largest holdings after DJT...which is going to lose ALL value once he leaves office. I PRAY he holds onto it until then."
2025-08-01,"Nope, I'm never making that mistake lol. I just sold Reddit at a profit of 35% 2 days ago, and now it's up an additional 18% after its earnings🫠"
2025-08-02,"Gotta remember, not everyone was here when it was 230 two splits ago or at 400 2 years ago...or even at 60 in early 24. 

  
There's a lot of FOMO when the China Export controls were taken off...plus the Saudi/Qatar deal, Stargate India, the Stargate here, all the hyperscalers raising capex.

  
And now, the funny thing, these companies are seeing massive ROI. Even Amazon, the company that dumped because it didn't grow it's cloud 32 or 36% like MSFT or META and only grew 17% despite increasing CapEx. 

  
That was one of the last contrived fears. The only one making money on AI was NVDA, AVGO and the people who build the stacks. 

  
So that's gone, the concern about losing the Chinese market, gone, the ChatCCP thing, history,...

  
It's ALL good news regarding NVDA... so it's ONLY because of Trump and the tariffs."
2025-08-02,"Again, I hate to repeat myself, but I like to pass on expertise when I can.

I asked my old College Roommate and friend growing up about this. He manages 1.5B and is a Sr VP at one of the 3 largest investment banks in the world.

He said, ""there's no recession, we just came out of the recession, the market got a little overheated and the orange idiot opened his mouth again. Might dump another 10%, but you're in this for the long run, this is still going over 200 this year.""

  
And then he gave me advice on AVGO and AMZN...and they're always the same. ""buy AMZN every time you get paid and keep AVGO, buy if it gets back to 250...but it won't.""

  
Take that for what it's worth, but he told me about NVDA in 2015, he gives out very little advice, but he's NEVER steered me wrong when he has. 

Oh, also, buy TSM. He added that. 

  
When I told him I have SMCI, he told me...'don't.' Not sure why, but that's the one I'm gong to fight him on!"
2025-08-02, Dude...why didn't you sell when it was 184?
2025-08-02,"...dude, it's 1000 dollars. You bought like 5 shares. You're going to lose like...50 dollars if you sell. You'll make 2555555555555-40 if you hold."
2025-08-04,Yep all 3 calls $155 & $180 @Oct 17. $178 @Dec 19
2025-08-01,Meanwhile they spy on the US non-stop & buy land near military bases/government buildings 🫥
2025-08-02,"It'll take more than a week. 

It'll be choppy for a couple months(unless earnings absolutely crush, but we haven' had much time to sell the H20s to China since Trump reversed the export controls and the Quarter ended last week, so all the H20 shipments right now will be for next Quarter). 

Worst months in the Market on average

Sept 55% of the time it's down and the average it's down is 7-8%

August is the 2nd worst, 40% of the time it's down and it's down 2.1%

June is the 3rd worst.

  
But NVDA's earnings have a chance if their margins are back up and they can come in at 52B or so with the H20 deliveries to push this back up to 190."
2025-08-02,Or maybe be a real investor and adult and just...ride the minor bump and stay in it.
2025-08-02,"Yes... we should ALL feel blessed when we lost money. 

LOL...what asinine logic.

You mean people who don't have enough in it and want to buy more?

That's not everyone. I own all the NVDA I'm going to own. Now I'm just waiting for 267 and I hit 8 figures twice over and I'm out. 

I take that out, pay 4.5M in Capital Gains and then retire, hopefully by 45 and live off of the interest while I leave my Roth and the rest of my investments in the market!"
2025-08-01,Most of the market is down the same or more. So they all can’t be falling because of that
2025-08-02,"Buy Amazon today, buy AMZN tomorrow, buy it yesterday, buy it tomorrow. 

5-10 years from now, AMZN may very well be the largest market cap in the world. 

If it's not in 15 years from now...well, then someone decided it was a monopoly and broke it up. 

But 770B in revenue and they haven't even really tried to maximize their revenue yet, they're still spending on everything. Live sports, AI(obviously AI), on autonomous delivery, drone delivery, robotics... everything. 

They're going to slash their workforce which is a shame, but they're going to make a WHOLE lot of money. 

  
NVDA and AMZN are going to be the two companies battling for the largest market cap by 2030 and if not by 2030(NVDA has sooo much demand that's not yet slowing) then by 2035."
2025-08-02,"There is ONE time I wish I would have sold NVDA.

I was invested in real estate. That was going to be my retirement. I started at 21 with an inheritance, by the time I was 30, I have 60 units...while working 60 hours a year as an ADA and still living at home trying to pay everything off and working a total of \~90+ hours a week. 

  
I had sold ONE triplex in Chicago because I got a great offer on it. Nice place on the North Side.

A friend and someone who manages 1.5B right now(didn't know what he was doing in 2015 when he first told me to buy or 2019 when he again told me to buy now and it'd make me rich, but turns out he was a Sr VP at a top 3 investment bank in the country, the youngest they've ever had). 

  
Anyway, sold that property, took everything after taxes and put it in NVDA when it was about 230 a  share. Bought 1500 shares. It split, so 6000 shares, went up to 320 IIRC at it's ATH and then....crashed. Lost 60%, down to 120 at it's low... again, if memory serves. 

I kept asking him if I should sell and even now he'll give me the same answer. ""I'm not... it'll come back, but if you want to sell and try to get back in lower...go ahead.""

That was when it was still at 280. 

AT this point I was done with the rental properties and the stress that came with it, so I started selling everything. By mid '23, I was putting everything in the market. 

  
I could have bought \~12000 shares or more if I'd have sold at \~250  or so. But I didn't. Instead, when it started coming back, I bought another 1000 shares. 

  
Hard to complain when it's up 3300%, and I probably wouldn't have put it all back in, but if I could do it over again, I'd have sold then and then bought thousands of more shares. 

I could have bought 20-30K shares when it was at 140! 

  
But you can do that for literally everything. I'm more than happy with the 1500 shares I bought and the 1000 shares I added in '23. With the splits since then, it's made it so I can retire by 45 if I want to(I don't want to)... but definitely before 55...though I love what I do now that I'm not fielding calls about a stove that doesn't work and it's not plugged in or having my Dad running all over Chicago, and Wisconsin being a handman.

  
And he refused to take a dime when I sold. So I bought the old man a '67 Chevelle SS....the car he always said he wanted. Rebuilt engine, everything. That was over 2 years ago now. 

  
It has 340 miles on it. Fucking waste of money!"
2025-08-03,Holding for decades!!!!!!
2025-08-02,"So what? We don't let them. 

What a silly argument. 

If they found out NVDA was spying and had a backdoor, they should stop buying. I think it's bullshit posturing, but if it was America, would you just buy Chinese GPUs if you suspected they were used for spying or could be used to take control of the stacks just because we all spy on each other?"
2025-08-03,"Or maybe it’s blessed we have shares up or down, yeah?"
2025-08-02,"Ok, but it's only up about 18% since \~12 months ago, maybe 14 months ago. 

Still a great return, but starting with liberation day, unless you bought the stock then, it's not a very accurate reference point.

  
That said, GYINA is open to the H20 again and Nvidia is shipping hundreds of thousands of them. They probably shipped a million of them before this Quarter came to an end(just a week or so ago). 

We also have \~47B left in approved stock buy-backs, so should there be a more prolonged drop because of Trump's fuckery again... which is entirely possible as the market has become immune to it(not immune, but less reactive) they may start buying more back."
2025-08-02,"No, it's got no legs. This isn't insider trading, but I have a pretty good connection to someone who manages 1.5B for a top 3 investment bank in the world, and I asked him about that. He said it was nothing more than China making noise.

  
China is trying to persuade it's companies to buy it's GPUs from Chinese companies, but they're buying from NVDA. 

  
I was unsure if it was a good idea for Trump to open China for National Security reasons(I was goddamn giddy as a NVDA shareholder) but... that's nothing. They have massive orders for the H20. 

They had existing supply, so their margins on the H20 are goin to be enormous this quarter. It came just early enough for it to be included in Q3 earnings... which along with margins expected to go back up due to the Blackwell ramp... should bode well for their overall DC Margins getting back up into the mid to upper 70s as they projected."
2025-08-02,"No, Martin was mis-understood. 

You see, what had happened was, he had to raise prices 700% because...what he wanted to do was cure cancer, autism and everything else that ails mankind and he was so close to doing it before they banned him from ever working in that field again!

  
Now after losing all of his money, he's back at it again and now he's calling Quantum ""fake"" and has put 100M into shorting all Quantum stocks.

  
He's a real...Man of the People. Lots of empathy there! 

  
(just talking about him makes me want to shower)."
2025-08-02,Agreed. Got 💵ready and waiting to deploy but will wait till end September or until I get my price targets
2025-08-03,"Well... keep buying... and holding. It takes both. If you can find a way to save 400-500 a month, put that in every month and... you'll be on your way. 

Or put 100 bucks a month in...whatever the fuck you can. Eat more mac and cheese. I don't know what you do or how old you are, but compound interest is a wonderful thing. 

  
And if you have a Roth, even better. Max that bitch out. Drive a beater. 

I did this Math when I was 22 and graduated and was getting ready for Law School. I could afford a new car or I could drive my old Impala. 20K for a new car that...I REALLY wanted. I'm 40 now. That 20K has become about 180K now.... and if I'd have put it in NVDA, it'd be like.... fucking... millions. I think 1K from 2004=440K. So 20X 8.8M. 

But still, just in the market and that's the type of return you'll get. 

Eth or BTC could also yield massive returns."
2025-08-03,"No. 

Why would I feel ""blessed"" to lose money?

You also explicitly said ""we should all be blessed it's DOWN."" 

Inferring it's a good thing people were pooer on paper because it was DOWN."
2025-08-04,"I love this man! I feel validated. I just recently got into thinking about retirement and future planning. I'm 32, I live in Hawaii which is a killer cuz how expensive everything is. I'm trying very hard to get into position where I'm maxing my Roth every year and still putting money towards just equities. I only have student loans and my truck loan both at 4.25% and 4.00% interest respectively. Hustled my high interest debts off and never doing that again. Hoping to retire with dignity!  Baby brokerage has just under $6k."
2025-08-03,"Please, prey-tell, explain the logic here? 

I must be Chinese because I think it's posturing on China's behalf to suggest that Nvidia is writing a back door into the H20...

On top of that, I responded to the your argument that because they try and spy on us, they shouldn't be worried about us spying on them, a regarded statement if I've ever heard one. 

  
Basically... just common sense. IF they found out Nvidia was spying....which I already said I thought was bullshit, then, if I were China, I wouldn't let them.

  
And because of that post, you conclude that...I must be Chinese?

  
Brilliant. 

And no, I'm about 75% German, 12.5% Norwegian and 12.5% French.... and it may shock you to hear this, but we spy on all of our European allies as well as hostile Nations alike."
2025-08-03,"LOL....""keep losing?""

What are you babbling about? I'm up about 3300% since I bought my first 1500 shares at 230 a share in late 2019 early 2020.

I'm up about 410% since I bought my last 1000 shares since I bought at \~400 a share in '23.  
If that's losing... what the hell are YOU doing here sport! You can do math...I'd hope. 1500 shares two splits ago...and then another 1000 one split ago. I HOPE I ""keep losing,"" like that!

And this is about 45% of my portfolio.

But honestly, I don't even know WHAT you're babbling about here.

I said the stock going down doesn't make me ""blessed,"" and you come back with your incoherent

>""Keep thinking like the rest of the 95% and keep losing.

LOL...I was SOO blessed then in late '21 to '22! Wow was I lucky when it went from...320 to 120 or whatever it was exactly! I was also super lucky when it hit an ATH at 974in March two a year ago and then back down to 720 intraday and hell, even more ""blessed"" when it went from 149 to 88 after the idiot we elected decided Smoot-Hawley leading to the great depression wasn't good enough, he was going to raise tariffs to the highest levels since Fordney-McCumber!

>Or maybe it’s blessed we have shares up or down, yeah?



What are you a participation awards type of guy?

Maybe it's ""Blessed"" we have shares ""up OR down, yeah?""

Uh...no. Nothing ""blessed"" about any of this. This has nothing to do with ""Religion"" or being ""Holy,"" this is about numbers and money there skippy.

Stock up=good. More money  
Stock down=No good. Less money.

You're overcompensating for something here guy.

We all get the stock is volatile and that it's NEVER going to go up in a straight line. It's not a holy thing when it does. It's just part of the market. It's just a risk off trade or people taking gains(not the case here) or uncertainty... caused by a clown.

This was an amusing post. Just level of confidence in which you said stupid things...I couldn't help but laugh."
2025-08-01,LEAVE THIS FUCKING SUBREDDIT ALREADY
2025-08-01,"Sold for gains yesterday. Thank God.
Already dropping again.
Trump just announced more Tarriff crap.

Will buy back in after the market responds."
2025-08-01,NVDA is the long-term hold. I was in before the split and thought - oh: 400 to 500? Can't go higher... I was looking at short term TA and regret it to this day. Back in months ago and already up almost 20%. Don't even look anymore except to DCA or play SPY/QQQ
2025-08-01,"this will be bear trap #145, more to come"

2025-08-01,"Hahaha, it's doing pretty much exactly what I expected it to do today. Glad I took profits yesterday.
Will buy back in later."
2025-08-01,Yup. I can imagine seeing both $250 and $120. The question is in which order
2025-08-01,Im not selling all mine
2025-08-01,Long term hold! Short term fluctuations don't care! lol
2025-08-01,"Glad I waited. Trump opened his big floppy mouth, and announce worldwide Tarriffs again. He just can't help himself. So today will most likely be a better day to buy back in.

2025-08-01,With 1k I'd just go all in. Leave it be until you retire or Nvidia stops innovating. Don't worry about the ups and downs because you only lose when you sell. Thats why you stay in for years.
2025-07-31,"Don't put all your money in one stock. Or even one segment of the market. Do your research, find a number of companies across the board that you can believe in, and invest in them.

As a general rule, don't buy during the first hour of the market...tends to be all day trading, with wild swings that have nothing to do with the rest of the day.

And don't invest all your money at the same time. Even as small as $1000.

Not saying NVDA shouldn't be one of the stocks you invest in...it should. But the days when you could plunk a bunch of money down without having a clue and NOT lose your shirt are over. You need to have at least a marginal clue of what you're doing these days."

I would DCA that 1k into an index ETF over 5 months, and split your regular monthly DCA 50/50 into index ETFs and NVDA. This will keep most of your investment pretty safe, while also taking advantage of NVDA’s growth. By not sinking all $1k into anything now, you’ll have the advantage of DCA with that $1k too.

Don’t bother timing. You’ll never do it well."

2025-08-03,"Good to know! What are some of the downsides of trading through Roth IRA? Can you take profits like normal if you needed too, or is that money tied up until retirement age?"
2025-08-01,bought a couple of shares today at 170
2025-08-03,"There are some drawbacks, if you do trades with money in the Roth the money must settle first (basically once you take profits or sell off completely).

So example of this would be if I 200 shares of Nvidia, if I sold off all/ part of it I cannot use that money from trading the shares until the next business day. 

You can you use Roth forever you can also do withdrawals with little or no tax if you hold the Roth and those funds for at least 5 years ( you can close it completely at 59 1/2 years old) .

At the moment any money you make via trades (outside of a Roth) is counted as regular income (basically if you make 50k a year working and 20k a year trading you still pay 22% on all that money (assuming you have no losses you can write off))."

2025-07-31,"In case you haven't noticed, over the last couple of years the percentage of people on Reddit who are only capable of handling an echo chamber...with NO opinions that do not validate their own...has multiplied. 

Largely because the people who CAN handle this kind of discussion have increasingly lost patience with the aut...sorry, ""echo chamber""...types and the ""anyone who does not validate what I want to believe is either evil or irredeemably stupid"" attitude.

So yeah, nowadays, most subs aren't here for discussion. Just a lot of people reinforcing a particular mindset to the point of utter ridiculousness. Often behaving like a kindergarten class in doing so.

And of course, having a ""one way and one way only"" approach to investing means there's a lot of denial and wishful thinking and even MAGICAL thinking rather than the recognition that a flexible approach works best in a market that is as unpredictable as the stock market is these days.

Gotta cherry pick with a LOT of care to find the nuggets in 'mongst the dross."

I just like good stocks that make me money, AMD included.

2025-07-31,"My history with these companies is nearly 20 years long.  The rivalry goes back to the time AMD CEO at the time Hector Ruiz wanted to by Nvidia.   Jensen said sure, if I'm the CEO.   Hector said no, and instead bought ATI.  (These companies were pretty cooperative before this business wise, teaming up to go after intel.)

So a graphics rivalry was born to match the AMD/Intel rivalry.   The hardcore fans were really about whose GPU were faster/better, and like every other graphics chip supplier, AMD ended up in an inferior position (today about 10% market share in both desktop and data center).

The stock rivalry really goes back to 2015 or so when AMD was at their low and Nvidia was basically reconstituting the holy grain of computing, modern AI.  The argument is always that an investment in AMD has ""better potential.""  

Unfortunately the rivalry stems from always being the underdog (to intel and now Nvidia), feeling second best.  AMD fans seemed to think for a while that AMD was going to pull on Nvidia the same move they pulled on Intel.   I admit I have been part of that dialogue a staunch defender of what I thought was the better investment.   Anyway, it still persists.  AMD fans have taken over forums like r/hardware, you can't hardly make a postive post about Nvidia without being downvoted into oblivion."

2025-08-01,i mean would you rather invest into intel??? \*insert goodfellas meme laugh\*
2025-07-31,"LOL... this is true. 

I guess this is kinda like banging your head against the wall. It's pretty futile. 

Back in April... on my old account(I made the mistake of posting on a Johnny Depp Sub that I didn't realize was an anti-Depp sub and I made one passing comment and they banned me and my IP...so I had to go back to this old account) I said on the other NVDA stock site that I was going to invest buy AMD, AVGO and then a couple others like META when it was under 500, whatever, just 2 days into ""liberation day,"" and the MOD posted probably 30 times telling me why NVDA was a better company.

Like... bud, I'm not saying it's not. It's also by far my largest holding. I love NVDA... but it's NOT the only stock that's going to make money.

  
This dude even went into my post history to find a post where I was talking about Eth and talking about investing(I've mostly stayed out of the Crypto space...foolishly). 

  
So yeah, I'm aware... but I thought I'd still give it a go!"
2025-07-31,"Yup. I have conviction in NVDA right now, but zero loyalty. NOBODY should. I count Loyalty as thee most important character traits in anyone I surround myself with... but this is just... investing.


I mean...I'm still biased and I try not to be. Jensen Huang has changed my life with his vision. He turned my initial investment of ~345K into a 3300X return...truly life chaging money and then again around 40 a share(400). Another 400K and it's up 420% or so.

And I'll FINALLY sell a share if I believe it's a bubble that's ready to pop."
2025-07-31,"I think the people saying this are doing the others who come here for information a disservice.

I would certainly have expected something more than ""if you want to buy AMD, buy AMD."" Thank you, but I did so prior to asking for your permission. I bought 5000 shares at ~81 dollars.

I also bought AVGO, 4750 at 150 a share. But, if you read the posts on here... from the people who bring up AMD and use terms like ""AMD fanbois."" And they say you un-ironically, it's clear most of them don't really understand the market.



But let me ask YOU this. You asked why I care. 

So... why do YOU care that I care? Ignore the thread the thread if you don't like it."
2025-07-31,"Yeah, you're right there. For 2 years before I sold liquidated most of my real estate... which was a painstakingly slow process, my only investment was NVDA. 

That was...great watching it go up after splitting and then hitting 320 or so again...and then crashing to 120. 

  
Though... if I was going to put all my money in one stock it'd probably be AMZN(or BRK.B, though that's kinda cheating). 

  
AMZN is going to make a Trillion dollars in a couple years and pretty much all they've been doing is reinvesting in the business. In AI obviously, in Prime Video with the professional sports, everywhere. Just across the board. when the time comes they start cutting their CapEx and they're earning 1T+ a year... they're going to be a 5-6T market cap.

I think they had 770B in revenue last year(last 12 months, not Fiscal year)? I may be wrong and I'm not going to look it up right now, but it's an incredible number... 



For at least the next decade or two, AMZN is going to be the new IBM. 'Nobody ever got fired buying AMZN.'

  
But that's getting off-topic. I agree."
2025-08-02,"Yes, but what I'm saying here is that I'm seeing AMD being brought up on NVDA sub reddits.

I understand why AMD subreddits would bring up NVDA. They're... the market leaders. 

But I don't understand why NVDA subs would bring up AMD. 

  
I'm also a bit confused...for reasons I've listed ad nauseum why people believe it so hard to envision AMD out-performing NVDA's returns over the next \~2 years. 

AMD is \~1/20th the size and it takes far less for AMD to move. And given their DC revenue was just 3.7B last Quarter and the number of announcements they've made, plus the the X-box deal, the fact that MSFT, META and most hyperscalers are using AMD(not nearly as much as NVDA, again, but they're 1/20th the size). 

However the SA and Qatar deals, AMD is set to earn 20B in DC revenue from just those two ventures and they are more competitive when it comes to inference(though despite being MORE competitive, they're also behind AVGO in this respect). 

  
Finally, if AI CapEx reaches 1T per annum by 2030... AMD is going to be picking up MORE than enough crumbs to justify a significantly a significant increase in valuation. 

  
Again, I see AMD reaching a 1T market cap before NVDA gets to a \~13T market cap(300% return respectively}. 

So my question is...well, to be blunt, everyone's shitting on AMD on here pretty regularly, they're starting numerous threads about AMD, but I think AMD has an easier path to 2X, 3X their returns over the next few years than NVDA does. 

  
I'm not even suggesting AMD takes ANY more market share from NVDA, simply that AMD is undervalued given the projected growth in the sector(and you would need to look at Non-GAAP to find an accurate representation of that as they still have Hlinx on there, a write off, but an acquisition they don't owe a penny for, yet still have 12 or so years of tax breaks available to them. 

  
This is to say, I think AMD can hit 400 a share before NVDA hits 400 and 600 a share well before NVDA can hit 600 a share, yet this board treats NVDA like their favorite sports team rather than an investment. 

  
I think that's a terrible way to look at an investment. An investment should be cold and calculating. 'Which company is going to make me the most money the next year, not which company has made me the most the past 7. 

  
I mean, what NVDA has done for me, I can't put into words, and yet, I'd have no trouble dumping all my shares and investing elsewhere if I found what was clearly a better investment. 

I'm not selling NVDA. I'd trigger low 7 figure capital gains, but I AM invested in AMD...and AVGO. One thing I was thank ful for on liberation day. I was able to get them at 82 a share and 150 a share. 



I guess my main issue is that too many investors seem to have an emotional connection with NVDA...which isn't healthy and they blindly dismis AMD despite exceptional growth potential."
2025-08-02,"No, it doesn't. It's not related. 

My argument is that NVDA is a 4.5T company and it takes a LOT for their stock to move(though, closer to 4.2T now). 

  
But what I think is going to happen is that they're picking up these deals that Trump negotiated. The Suadi Arabia and Qatar Deal, that's 20B in Data Center Revenue. 

They sell to all the hyperscalers like Googl, Meta, Amzn,..just not as much, but they're all increasing their capex.

They're a pretty big part of the 500B Staregate project.

they're part of the staregate India project.

And their total DC revenue last year, 12.5B. Last Q it was 3.7B. 

Their market cap is \~270B. So \~1/20th the size of NVDA. 

They don't need to...and they won't come close to NVDA in the near future, but they don't need to. Just that revenue should send AMD to a 600B market cap. That's 2X. 

For NVDA to 2X, it'd need a 100B QUARTER. And they'll get there. 

  
By 2030, the projected AI CapEx is expected to reach 1T per year. 

It's That's a 5X increase and I think AMD is going to pick up a LITTLE bit of NVDA's 92% market control. 

But even if they don't... it should go up.

  
And, by the way, when you look at PE, they bought Hilinx using share dillution, so their PE ratio is way off. It's an accounting thing for taxes for the next 12-15 years. 

Look at Non-GAAP. 

Forward PE is lower than NVDA. 

So no, I don't think it'll move with NVDA, I think it's stock price will outperform NVDA the next couple years. But it won't come CLOSE to touching NVDA unless it comes out with something revolutionary. The problem, when they're making 12.5B, it's hard to match NVDA's 7B investment in staying ahead. 

  
This is my theory. I also think SMCI is going to 3-4X the next 18 months. 

  
BUT... these are MY guesses. I got in NVDA in 2019 and bought 1500 shares. Those shares split 4-1 and then 10-1.

I then bought another 1000 in '23. That was after the 4-1 split, but before the 10-1 split. 

So...I can afford to take some chances. And so far, they've been paying off, but...I feel pretty good about this. I bought it at 82 a few months ago when it was called ""Advanced Money Destroyer."" People mocked it then as well. 

  
I see AMD going below 150 right now though. It doesn't have the support that NVDA, the Giant in the industry has."
2025-08-02,"Oh... well if you're looking for the NEXT NVDA, you're a fool. Or, if you have 20 years, it's AMZN. That's going to be a 12-15T market cap in 15 years or so. So that's close to a 10X growth. But NVDA has been 3300% since 2019.

But maybe NVDA will 3-5X in that same time. I'm just struggling to see it. It would take massive breakthroughs for NVDA to get there. Not necessarily by NVDA, but it's going to take Robotics, it's going to take FSD taking over(that could be 1T a year and NVDA is going to be licensing a LOT of the tech for that).  

  
  
What you SHOULD be looking for is 15% growth per annum while ALWAYS putting more money into your account. Spend less than you make, keep investing and you'll be worth millions if you start in your 20s or 30s. 

  
If you get lucky...as I have, you can take some bigger swings and you can retire a bit earlier. Also have to make your own luck. I lived at home working 90 hours a week until I was 28. I was buying rental properties non-stop while working 60-70 hours a week as a Lawyer. It wasn't until 5-7 years ago I started selling off the rental properties. First with NVDA and that was because one of the smartest investors I've ever known, a friend I grew up with and my College Roommate told me to invest in NVDA. So I started with just one duplex. Sold that...and saw the growth. 

Then sold the rest, put it in the market and the returns were better and the stress was... gone."
2025-08-02,"I'll also add, 10K invested in AMD in 2014 would be 700K today. 

AMD was a MASSIVE underdog to INTC. That doesn't mean they'll pass NVDA. NVDA is... the gold standard and they have 90% market share. But that 10% market share that AMD is...picking up more and more pieces of...albeit SMALL pieces, they do NOT need to take 30 or even 20% of that market share.

  
They just need to keep up with the AI CapEx and AMD is going to grow a LOT. It WON'T be 3300% over the next 6.6 years like NVDA, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it growing 400%. 

  
That is a millionaire maker. 

  
AMD's growth from it's 5B growth from it's Instinct GPU, a 50X increase. 

Lisa Su is a great CEO. 

  
But the MAIN thing I'm trying to articulate is...they don't need to catch NVDA. They just need to keep growing like they have. Keep the market share as the CapEx goes up and NVDA is supply constrained. That's going to propel more growth in AMD's share price than NVDA going from 50B(take that 4.6B write off away as they can now use those H20s and they've been shipping to China) and compare it to AMD's GUIDANCE which was 7.1B BEFORE they signed several massive contracts and by the way, China was also re-opened to them. 

  
Sorry for the long post, there is no ""next NVDA,"" but there is a company right in front of us that can become a 1T market cap in 3-4 years."
2025-08-02,"Yeah... I'm not sure you read my post.

I'm asking why people on the NVDA subs are constantly talking about AMD and talking about ""AMD fanbois,"" and things like that.

And if you argue that AMD could VERY easily see better returns the next...2 years or so, or may 2X, 3X more easily than NVDA will 2X or 3X, they either start telling you how NVDA is so far ahead and SO advanced... which... yeah, of COURSE. They are worth 4T more than AMD.

My first question is why are we even talking about ""fanbois?"" I'd buy DJT stock if I thought it'd 2X. I don't care, I ONLY care about the the bottom line.

I'm up...well, 3270% since I invested in NVDA...those 1500 shares have split twice. The last 1000 split another time. Love it. I even love Jensen Huang for what he's done for me. Doesn't mean I won't buy AMD simply because NVDA is their competitor. There's literally supply constraints.

  
What's more, AMD had 3.7B in DC revenue. JUST between the Saudi and Qatar deals, they're looking at 20B in DC revenue. META, GOOGL, AMZN, all the hyperscalers are also increasing their investment in AMD GPUs.

  
So which is easier to move. A company with 3.7 DC revenue that's already got 5X that Guaranteed in just two particular deals(plus China hurt AMD more than NVDA). 

I think AMD triples more easily than NVDA does. 

  
So NVDA may be taking the train, but it takes a LOT more to get that train moving and a lot more to get that train to keep rolling than it's going to take AMD. 

  
And again, mind you, I only have 5,000 shares of AMD, so I'd be thrilled to be wrong. I just don't think I am."
2025-07-31,"LOL... sure. 

You are a great representation of the point I'm trying to make just by using the term ""fanbois,"" and... I can't tell if you just didn't read it or if you're obtuse.

That attitude is FAR more prevalent on NVDA boards(so far as I can see, don't spend too much time on either as there are too many people with this mentality and it's... probably holding them back.

People who've been in NVDA since it broke 3T Or 3.5T and think they're early."
2025-08-02,"Yeah, ""Bro,"" you quite literally could NOT have gotten what I'm saying MORE wrong if you tried. 

  
Did you miss where I said I picked up 5000 shares of AMD and 4750 more of AVGO? I also invested in SMCI? This is just in the AI space... as well as some other investments AI related, but these are the core investments.... as well as TSM obviously. I've been in TSM for a couple years, I'm talking about the last year, namely after April when I invested. 

  
But lets go through your comments and MY post....

>Ai is the future might as well buy into it.

  
Jesus Christ... YA THINK?

It's almost like I said; ***AI Capex could reach 1T per annum by 2030.***

  
So what else did I say about AMD?



>**But AMD has gotten massive investments themselves. The Saudi Arabia and UAE announcements were BOTH NVDA and AMD.**

>**AMD guided for 7.1B to 7.8B for next Quarter**. **So what do you think is going to happen when Qatar and Saudi Arabia both invest 10B into AMD's GPUs, META, GOOGL, AMZN, they ALL use AMD as well.**

>So... is NVDA by FAR the most dominant company? Fuck yes it is.

>**But if you're ONLY investing in NVDA and ignoring the rest of the market... I think you're really missing out**... but that's fine, that's your decision. I just don't get why there are so many threads about AMD and how they're so far behind NVDA. **They don't NEED to catch NVDA. They just need to pick up the scraps.**

>

>**They're projecting 1T CapEx for GPUs by 2030. That's not ALL going to Nvidia and AMD has a much easier time seeing a 200-300% improve over the next 5 years than NVDA does. That'd put AMD at \~1T and NVDA at 13T.**  
*Also, AVGO, SMCI, TSM... these are all GREAT investments.*

>Anyway, the point, it's not a team sport. Try and be objective. The whole point is to retire early or retire comfortable, to be able to take care of your family**. Not root for NVDA like you're a fan of just one company and you're too loyal to that company to look at other competitors.**

  
And YOUR response is;

 **I like to diversify. Amd is doing some good things with their chips as well. Ai is the future might as well buy into it.**



So EXACTLY what I was saying in my posts? 

  
Yeah, maybe read the whole thread before saying, ""Bro we get it,"" when you got it 100% wrong."
2025-08-02,"No... I wouldn't. 

Has INTC gone up \~115% in the last 3 months? 

Has INTC gotten 20B in contracts from SA and Qatar coming off a quarter in which they only reported 3.7B in DC revenue?

I'm not sure the point of bringing up INTC."
2025-07-31,"They have huge Depreciation & Amortization, exactly why you should not make investments decisions based on one number alone. Their Price/Revenue beats Nvidia. I am still holding much more Nvidia than AMD, but your argumentation is way too simplistic."
2025-07-31,"Oh, I've been banned on more subs than you can shake a stick at...including a couple where I'm a real-world expert on the subject.

Sigh...I remember when Reddit wasn't like this. I mostly stick around because I have a few long-standing chats on the side."
2025-07-31,"I'm just surprised you're spending so much time on this, for what? To convince people it's worth it? This is r/NvidiaStock, not r/AMD_Stock.

Yeah, most people here don’t really understand investing or how the market works. They’re here because they want to see posts like 'NVDA to ATH tomorrow' or 'NVDA will hit $1000 by the end of 2025.'

They’re just looking for confirmation of their decision. That’s all.

>So... why do YOU care that I care? Ignore the thread the thread if you don't like it.

Well... if you post something online keep in mind that people can comment on that. So I put my comment and now I can say the same *if you do not like my comment, ignore it or if you can't handle others opinion, don't post nothing online.*"
2025-08-03,"As I say, I've been following these companies for a long time.  AMD longs nearly \*always\* think AMD's stock is a better value and or has more potential than Nvidia.   But except for a few golden moments it hasn't been true over sustained periods.

Here is my simple break down between these two companies:   Nvidia is out creating market for it's products.  A few examples:  Programmable GPU shaders for consumer.  Ray tracing and DLSS.   GPU accelerators for HPC and Data Centers.  NVLink/NVSwitch.  SoCs for self driving, robotics and drones.   Massive parallel computation solutions for complex AI training and industrial level AI inferencing.

AMD isn't creative in the same way.  They are a follower, not a leader.

Nvidia's ability to apply their core technology to dozens of novel applications is the key to them multiplying their MC and why they can continue to do so into the future.

AMD doesn't have the same internal investment philosophy.  Lisa's model is open source software, she's said it dozens of times.   She wants the market to engineer and develop their own use cases.   And perhaps then naively she hasn't figured out she needs to provide robust support in order for external development to succeed, let alone open new markets."
2025-07-31,"LOL...I just saw his response and wrote out a whole thing.
I'm right there with you. I own a fraction of AMD as compared to NVDA, but...the Non-GAAP is more important there. Also, where was NVDA when it made it's big run after the '21-'22 crash?

It often had a VERY high PE.

You want AI, Growth and a low PE, SMCI is a good one, and if you want a Giant, Alphabet is your stock."
2025-07-31,"I wasn't, but I'll revise my response as you oversimplified my judgement here.

P/E ratio is one take and it's historically been exceptionally high for AMD. I've been waiting for it to come down to a more reasonable level to reflect the positivity of their financial outlook. It's not there yet in my opinion. Even on a pro-forma ""non-GAAP"" basis (OP).

But if you want to compare like-for-like, Nvidia has a much higher EPS, profit margin, return on assets/equity. What's your point? You're literally doing the same thing by focusing on one or two metrics (D&A and P/R)."
2025-07-31,">Well... if you post something online keep in mind **that people can comment on that**. So I put my comment and now I can say the same *if you do not like my comment, ignore it or if you can't handle others opinion, don't post nothing online.*

Yes... I'm acutely aware of that fact. I'm sorry, have I somehow given you the impression that I was of the belief that you weren't could NOT comment on that?

I'm sorry, but I'm confused, is there a reason you're telling me how commenting works? YOU'RE the one who said ""why do you care,"" and have now replied with two length posts.

Of course you CAN reply. Who ever suggested otherwise?

I made what... I'm sure you believed to be a VERY clever remark and I responded likewise asking why YOU cared enough to respond.

Nowhere in there did I suggest you COULDN'T.

>Why do you care?

So I answer and you feel the need to inform me you're allowed to respond? That's odd.   


>I'm just surprised you're spending so much time on this, for what? To convince people it's worth it? This is [r/NvidiaStock](https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/), not [r/AMD\_Stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/).

I'm not surprised you're surprised as I don't know you at all... so I would have no expectations as to how you'd behave one way or the other. It's strange you have expectations of me. 

I like to see retail traders have success. I saw several posts where I thought bad information was being given out, so I felt like making my own post.

I have to say, I do so thank you for informing me this is NOT in fact the AMD sub reddit. That probably should have been clear to you when I expressly directed my questions to the NVDA sub reddit and shared my history, having been on Reddit and in NVDA since late 2019, but... I don't know, I suppose it's possible you missed that as you seem more interested in an argument than anything else.

\--Oh, I'd also argue it's not ""so much time,"" as it's a couple posts that take.... 2-3 minutes to fire off.

But you, who doesn't even care, you're... doing the same thing. That seems surprising.

>Yeah, most people here don’t really understand investing or how the market works. They’re here because they want to see posts like 'NVDA to ATH tomorrow' or 'NVDA will hit $1000 by the end of 2025.'

Ok. So if you're an experienced investor and have accumulated 7-8 figures in the market, you don't want to try and perhaps... try to at least share your experience?

And you seem to be annoyed by me doing so.

>They’re just looking for confirmation of their decision. That’s all.

Ok. Well, they can keep looking. I'm trying to offer another perspective as was offered to me when I was working 90 hours a week, 60 at my job and 30 hours managing rental properties and...I believe I said as much, but someone who's far smarter than I offered some unsolicited advice about a company few people had heard of at the time. Nvidia. 

  
That led to 3300% returns on the first 350K I put in and in truth, change my life...again, as I've said. I sold all the rental properties, tried to become more informed, put more money into NVDA... as well as a dozen other companies and here I am today with 40-50 more hours a week of free time and I thought I'd share my perspectives. That's all."
2025-08-03,"Yeah, I may not have been following these companies as long, but I've been invested in NVDA for going on 7 years and I've kept investing.



I'm less an ""AMD longs,"" than a AI long and for all you said, you're ignoring some... simple indisputable facts. 

AMD IS in demand.

3.7B in DC revenue vs... what, \~40B in DC revenue for NVDA. 

20B from SA and Qatar. 

About 1/3rd of META's GPU CapEx goes to AMD.   
Azure which just had a MONSTER quarter has been touting AMD MI300Instinct over the H100(I understand, we're onto Blackwell now, but AMD also has the MI355X Instinct which MSFT Executives have emphasized MI300X’s cost and performance edge over Nvidia H100s.

And with AWS exploding AI CapEx from investing in their own Trainium/Inferentia that are NOT on par with AMD's MI355 GPUs and AWS has publicly talked about working with AMD and now there are rumors they will be ordering the MI400 for it's inference capabilities.  

Azure, Meta, Oracle, IBM Cloud, also all order from AMD.

  
Your simple breakdown is... effectively just ""NVDA=better."" 

I don't care about that nearly as much as I care about HOW much the market is growing and the piece of the market AMD already has. 

They're also taking over gaming segments with an exclusive contract with MSFT for Xbox(which is not new) and the PS5's.



I don't care that NVDA is bigger, better, that they're the leader and AMD is the follower, that they're not creative in the same way.

  
I care that it's getting CLOSER... or hell, not even that it's getting closer.... though it seems obviously AMD IS in fact closing the gap with regard to inference.



I ONLY care that NVDA is over 20 TIMES better. 20 TIEMS more efficient and 1/20th the price OR that the Market is growing.

  
To the first point, they are not. To the 2nd point, the market is exploding. 



AMD is going to be growing at a faster rate than NVDA. 

DC revenue was 3.7B last Quarter. With the commitments they've gotten, they should be able to double that, and if AWS does go with AMD, who they've worked with before, but have no yet bought from en masse, assuming they do in fact change direction with regard to AWS(which is still just a rumor I'm getting from people in the industry who's job it is to know before this gets announced publicly, it won't hurt NVDA, but it's going to cause AMD to go on one helluva run. 

  
And with respect, I'm not looking at what they HAVE doesn't for a long time. I'm looking at where they're going from here. AMD can EASILY get to a 540B market cap long before NVDA can get to an 8.6T market cap."
2025-08-03,"Oh, and I completely forgot about AMD's Role in Stargate with their strong ties to Oracle.

While NVDA is supply constrained, the M1400 is going to be a huge part of project stargate. 

That, the SA and Qatar, their Azure demands are going to double, triple or more their Quarterly revenue just on DC in the next couple quarters. 

  
But this is why I made this thread. This is the response and it's so often initiated BY NVDA bulls, and god knows I'm one of them... I have 5000 shares of AMD and...15X as many shares of NVDA...but you can actually invest in both.

  
Again, if you believe the DC revenue is going to reach 1T per annum by 2030, you can't come to that conclusion without AMD's market cap seeing a 3X-4X increase. 

It's going to be REAL hard for NVDA to see 3-4X returns in that same period. And I don't need it to. If it can get to 6T, I'll be thrilled. 

  
But AMD is there picking up the slack from where NVDA can't and... that's going to spell massive increase in AMD's stock price over the next few years. 

Same with AVGO who may actually be leading with regard to inference, though much of it's value comes from working alongside AMD, NVDA to build out these Data Centers. 

I'd also add AMD may be more attractive to the small caps as interest rates start to come down, there are a LOT of industries that don't or won't want to spend 40K on the B200 when  they can spend 1/2 to 1./3rd of that on AMD and they don't need the speed and performance, but they'll be able to afford AMD.



But that's speculative. What's not is the demand AMD has RIGHT NOW, they're going to quickly double and triple theire DC revenue...and that's what will propel the stock to a 1T market cp in the next 4-5 years. 

If NVDA can do the same...well, I'll be retired at 44."
2025-07-31,"Well, I can only speak for myself, but no, I'm not ""literally doing the same thing by focusing on one or two metrics, before you deleted your post, I was trying to address your concern. 

  
AMD didn't actually BUY Xilinx. They diluted their stock to purchase it...meaning the amortization of intangibles with respect to cash does not cost AMD ANYTHING. And given the reduction of GAAP earnings, it REDUCES their tax liability for the next...\~12-15 YEARS. 

So the PE is not nearly as high as it suggests. 

But using that barometer, AMD had a PE of...like 1000 a couple years ago. That should tell you quite a bit about the value of PE taken by itself. 

  
I'd also ask you to look at NVDA's PE when it started it's real ascent in 2023 after going from...\~300 a share after the last split to \~120 a share. It was in the 110-140 range. 



Now, as for NVDA and AMD, if you want to just compare the two as though they're on equal footing, ignoring the 50B spent on Hilinx that they didn't really spend on Hilinx, that's fine. 

  
I'd simply suggest you look at them for what they are. A 4.5B company and a 270B company. 

AMD guided for 7.1B next quarter. So what do you think is going to happen when JUST two of the new contracts kick in, the 10B from Saudi Arabia and the 10B from Qatar?

  
So...I'll just recommend you do your own due diligence and look a bit deeper. I'd not recommend...well, anything to anyone beyond that, but I was going to say I wouldn't sell NVDA personally. I have said for years once it hits 182.50 I'm going to sell as I'll hit a nice round number that I've been looking forward to(after taxes)... but I think this can hit 210-220 by the end of F'26. 

  
I think AMD can hit 400 by the end of Fiscal '26. 

  
Just my opinion. NVDA is still the king of the Jungle... not disparaging the company that changed my life. 

Just sharing an opinion that AMD is going to see...AT LEAST similar returns in the next 2-3 years. My bet is they see better returns... but that's just me."

2025-08-02,">You asked why people like the stock.

  
Let me guess. You didn't read the post, did you? Didn't stop you from answering VERY confidently though...which is always amusing. 



And actually I didn't ask anyone ""why people like the stock."" Your reading comprehension is as poor as your writing ability.  

I also don't know which ""the stock"" you're talking about. AMD or NVDA?

  
What I DID ask is why people on NVDA sub./reddits KEEP bringing up AMD and constantly trying to dismiss simply because NVDA is in a more dominant position overall. MY position was that AMD has more room to grow in the next couple years. 

  
What I NEVER at any point did was ""asked why people like the stock."" 

  
But when I wrote about two stocks, BOTH of which I liked, and you respond like this, what TF am I even supposed to say to this?

>  
 Because the number is going up. What do you not comprehend?

  
You're really asking ME what I don't ""comprehend"" based on my post and you came away with 'because stock go up.'

You DID see where I talked about how there would be other winners in AI and that I believe the DC CapEx would reach 1T per annum by 2030 and then mentioned in addition to getting in on NVDA early and big, that I opened a position in AMD when it was around 80. I bought 5000 shares(as well as another 4750 when AVGO dropped down to the 150 range on liberation day). 



If you want to go back and READ the post, you'll see...I'm not at all confused WHY people WOULD like AMD.

What I'm confused about is why people who invest in NVDA treat this like Sports and ""root"" for one team over the other when the other seems to have more room for growth at the moment.

  
On the off chance you were talking about NVDA... well, that'd be even dumber given I said exactly how much I bought and when, starting in 2019. So if you were talking about NVDA...that'd be even worse. 

I suspect you're not going to respond, you don't seem to have the attention span, and that's fine. But if you're going to actually read the post as this was kinda embarrassing for you. If you have coherent point to make, I'd be interested in listening... but my guess is you come back with another post that's not on topic or nothing at all. 



""Stock go up,"" is one FANTASTIC analysis of why that stock has growth potential in the future though. You really outlined your bull or bear case wonderfully."

2025-08-04,"\>AMD IS in demand.

One question:    If Nvidia hadn't created that demand, where would AMD be?

The rest of your argument, you really haven't listened.  You're making up your own points to argue against.

AMD is a follower, Lisa doesn't understand GPUs.  Good luck with your investment."
2025-07-31,"I wasn't replying to your comment, but since you've replied...

It's just my opinion, and I think AMD is a risky investment at the moment.

People seem to be seriously exaggerating the effect of the Xillinx acquisition at the moment. The difference in gross margin between the GAAP and non-GAAP first quarter results is 4%. The diluted EPS is $0.44 GAAP vs $0.96 non-GAAP. A big difference, however Nvidia's first quarter diluted EPS is $0.76 GAAP vs $0.96 (exc. tax impact) non-GAAP. Point being that while non-GAAP diluted EPS is comparable, Nvidia's shares are comparatively much better value. This is why P/E ratio is important - it signifies that AMD could be significantly overvalued. Nvidia also has stronger growth potential."
2025-08-02,"Thank You. 

It's primarily just trying to get people to stop looking at the stocks you own with an emotional component to them. You should never form an emotional connection to your investments. It CAN be tough. I do...honestly get giddy when I think of NVDA and Jensen Huang. 

  
But looking at AMD... I'm just impressed with the moves their making. 

  
Anyway, thank you, appreciate the comment!"
2025-08-06,"The fuck it didn't.

They haven't gotten their Chinese export licenses yet(neither has NVDA BTW) and they just started ramping their latest chip...and they're raising prices.

And they beat on the top and the bottom...

AND if they get the export licenses...(none have actually been granted yet) they're going to have a massive Q3.

  
My comments yesterday about buying more AMD right now after being +100% this year;

>Eh... I don't know. I already bought NVDA and AMD. I bought AMD after ""liberation day,"" and I think it's got more upside the next 4-5 years, but I don't know that I'd buy it right now. They didn't have much time to sell to China since their quarter ending just shortly after Trump announced he was taking the export controls off.

>At this point if it moves 10% to the downside but the guidance is good, I may buy more.

>But I think the rest are just safer and going to consistently beat the market. I do think AMD can 2X or 3X the next couple years... but just need to see one earnings report to support that before I go any deeper.

  
And MS has a 235 PT on AMD. 

Price Increases just went into effect a few weeks ago and export licenses not yet issued.

This is a lot like talking after Q2, Q3, Q4 of last year for NVDA and trying to ""dunk"" on people who thought NVDA would hit 200+ end of F'26.

  
Remind me in 6 monthns!

I went from up \~500K in 4 months to up 450K. 

I'll take it!"
2025-07-31,"Ok... and what happened subsequent to Q1? 

When did AMD and NVDA get those contracts(which are pretty evenly split between the two with the Saudis and Qatar)? 

  
And no, they're not exaggerating the effect of Xillinx. That caused AMD to have a 1000 PE just two years ago. 

  
But hey, you have to do what you're comfortable with. I still love NVDA. I still haven't sold a share. 

I just decided to buy AMD, AVGO and SMCI most recently(\~4 months ago). 

And... of course TSM. Always keep adding to TSM and AMZN."

2025-07-31,"I'll quote CRN (June 5th):

*While Nvidia’s data center business grew both sequentially (10 percent) and year over year (73 percent), AMD’s revenue for the segment declined 4.8 percent sequentially but was 57 percent higher than it was a year ago.*

Ignoring speculative earnings from acquisitions, to me Nvidia has more certain future value based on a lower PE ratio + data center market dominance and growth.

AMD could work out very well for investors, I'm just saying that *for me* there's too much risk."
2025-08-08,"What's the market saying today?

What an ignorant post.

So NVDA wasn't in demand... MOST of the time after earnings?

The BEST comp would be when Blackwell was delayed in Q3 of F'25. How'd that work?

Or Q2?

Also, funny, their PTs got raised from ~200, 210, 220.

-Export licenses not yet granted.
Their price increase on the MI355 didn't start until next quarter.

With export licenses, MS has then coming in at about 15B next quarter... but until they get it, they can't guide for that.


But... man, this really makes my point. Therr are investors, and there are fanbois.

I saw my then 6000 shares of NVDA drop 60%. Held because I believed in the big picture.

Saw the then...70,000 shares drop from 150 to 88 because...again, I understand the market.

I don't look for earnings and then suddenly assume the market is rational and sell because it's down.


You're going to learn... NVDA, AVGO, and AMD are ALL going to go up. AMD will go up the most in the next ~3 years. NVDA may double in the next 5.

And...if you just want one stock, AMZN is going to beat all the large caps in the next 20-30.

2025-07-31,"Who is talking about ""speculative earnings from acquisitions?"" 

I'm not sure what point you're making. 

AMD posted 3.7B from Data Center revenue last Quarter. Since then, they've signed deals to provide Saudi Arabia and Qatar with at LEAST 10B dollars worth of GPUs to service the Data Centers they're building there.

  
I feel like you're not quite getting my point and I don't know if you're talking about Hilinx being a ""speculative acquisition,"" which would make... zero sense, it's simply a write off for the next \~15 years that at this point ADDS value, does not detract and it's certainly not speculative, it's years old. 

  
I'm also not sure who you're quoting. I'm not sure what CRN is, but... you can look at what AMD has done since the news of the recent projects have come out. AMD's revenue is going to double/triple EASILY in the next year. 

NVDA's is not. 

That's what I'm looking at. Not who is the better company... 

  
In any event, I'm not trying to get people to buy AMD, I'm just...trying to point out the value. It IS already up about \~120% from April Lows... as is NVDA, but AMD is just starting it's run. 

Well see what happens. I HOPE NVDA can 2X again as well. I do have... 15X as many shares in NVDA as AMD...so I'm just happy with all the AI CapEx."

don't be an ass."
2025-07-31,"They've spent a huge amount of money spread over many years of amortization to acquire Xilinx with the goal of increasing presence in the data center market (FPGAs for AI), which they've been struggling to do comparatively. It it doesn't pay off, then the tax offset from the expense of amortization won't cover it. They will have lost profitability."
2025-10-07,"LOL... nah, I just remembered this thread!

  
QBTS, AMD... if only more listened.... ah well!"
2025-08-02,"No, they have not.

They didn't spend a penny on Xilinx, they dilluted to purchase it and that's several years old.

AMD saw a 50X increase from their instinct GPU last year, up to 5B.

Nearly every company buying from NVDA is buying from AMD and losing China hurt AMD more than it hurt NVDA. China is open again.

AMD came in at 3.7B in DC revenue last Quarter. The Saudi Arabia and Qatar deals were were 20B just for their GPUs. That's 20B in DC revenue, not to mention META, MSFT, all the hyperscalers, Stargate is using AMD GPUs(NVDA still benefits more, but AMD is getting a piece of it).

NVDA will continue to DOMINATE the market share, but all AMD has to do is just...maintain their market share and with the GPU CapEx expected to reach 1T per annum by 2030, that leaves AMD with a LOT more room for growth.

Also, take away the Xilinx and look at Non-GAAP, and AMD has a lower PE than NVDA and a lower forward PE.

But AGAIN... I'm not selling a single share of NVDA(well, I may sell 5K to 10K to put into BTC or ETH, but I'm keeping the vast majority of it.

There are PLENTY of other AI companies that are going to see massive growth other than just NVDA.

And when it comes to inference, the next wave of AI, NVDA doesn't have AS big of a lead there. AVGO may end up being the closest competitor there with it's Asics, but AMD is closing the gap(a bit) with their GPUs.

Their large model inference with outstanding memory capacity, they're energy efficient and lower TCO matter more than just peak GPU speed.

AGAIN.... I'm not selling NVDA. I AM saying... look into AMD as they can move a LOT easier than NVDA based on their market cap being about 1/20th the size and the commitments they've already got.

Don't be surprised when their 12.5B in Data Center revenue(which was about half their overall revenue) comes in closer to 35-40B in the next 4 quarters... and given the time of the earnings, I'd expect NEXT Quarter, not when they report on Aug 5th to be when you see the real growth.

  
NVDA will have \~3 weeks of H20 sales to China where as AMD is just ramping their China sales back up. 

  
People are looking at who is the biggest and baddest and that's a great reason to own NVDA, but they're also undervaluing the #2 company in the market...

  
AMD will get to 1T before NVDA gets close to 13T...is my prediction."

2025-07-31,"scared money has never made a dime. If you are that worried about losing capital , Treasuries pay 4 percent for a 1 year T bill."
2025-07-31,"I got downvoted for saying NVDA was cheap back when it was $160. In 10 years, $183 will be considered dirt cheap. Mag7 companies are finally monetizing AI and Wall Street is salivating"
2025-07-31,"Fomo for when nvda is the most valued company in the world is probably a bad play shortterm. Becase what comes up must come down like in april when crashed. However, if you want to out this money away for a while. Then go for it.

Just do not sell when it goes down. For the love of god, just close your app and never open it until you need money."
2025-07-31,Gotta play the long game
2025-07-31,FOMO buy and panic sell
2025-07-31,You must be the only person who has lost money on nvidia.  I just put cash in $nvdl and go for the ride. Up over 100%. But my time line isn't 2 days and I do pull some off from time to time.
2025-07-31,"Stop orders screwed me... Back when NVDA was 1100 it spent that April dropping eventually triggered a stop loss I forgot about at 750ish...

I actually made out better... I waited until it settled and bought all of it back for $700/share.

It's best (IMHO) for ME to not use stop losses and just keep my head on a swivel.   You learn to just ride thru the waves like Trump tariff farts etc...

Until fundamentals change - NVDA is still destined for the moon.

Once fundamentals change and you notice a nasty downturn it will be up to you what to do at that point."
2025-07-31,Setting stoploss to guarantee buy-high-sell-low? That's brilliant!! It's difficult to lose money on NVDA but you found a way
2025-07-31,"I have this radical investing strategy - I buy and I hold. If any of you knew ANYTHING about this company, you would not try to timing anything, you’d stop buying and selling, you’d stop trying to figure if it was going up or down a point tomorrow! For the next 1-2 years this is the most fool proof way to make money in the stock market. Y’all just think you’re smarter than the rest. Y’all are a bunch of fools!!"
2025-07-31,"""i'm bad at timing the market, i should double down on it""

come on, you know that's stupid."
2025-07-31,"I have no sympathy for gamblers. If you're going to go for it, do it. But don't come crying if it goes south. 

In case you actually have no one in your life to tell you: This is next level dumb behavior, do NOT do this.

I am very long AI and NVDA, but still do not do this unless you are very young and have a high paying job and don't care if you lose all the money you put in. Never invest enough money in one stock that you'd be screwed if it went to zero tomorrow. If that's true, you need to diversify."
2025-07-31,Dont play option if you afraid of getting burn. Holding nvidia for long time will surely give decent return. Good luck OP.

2025-07-31,"I would put the money in SGOV and buy in average cost over 6 month. I have some extra cash and I'm doing that  right now.

For me, it is always less stressful to be in the market and forget about it. But when I'm holding cash, the least stressful strategy for me is to buy in over time so I don't have regrets of buying and losing money right after."
2025-07-31,Yep FOMOing at all time highs with all your money is definetely a sound idea. Make sure to panic sell when it consolidates
2025-07-31,"Nvidia is great stock BUT there will be a hard pull back (maybe 1-2%) tomorrow, don't panic it always happens it will bounce back in day or two. I would recommend till after the pull back to invest into it."
2025-07-31,It’s a bad idea
2025-07-31,One way to feel more confident about investing in nvda is to learn more about the company. Put in the time. Plenty of info on nvda on YouTube. Future of nvda is up.
2025-07-31,Just panic sell like me!
2025-07-31,When on earth did yolo translate into “SELL AT -1%!!!!”
2025-07-31,whats the point of 1 or 2% stop loss? just buy it at market. the only bargaining you are doing is FOMO
2025-07-31,"I’m holding cash waiting for something to crash, like when Deepseek was announced, or tariffs. We have the Aug. 1 deadline. MSFT and META had good earnings today. Amazon should be good too tomorrow. But a big correction will happen before the end of the year."
2025-07-31,You shouldn’t be investing on your own if you need Reddit to talk you off the ledge.  Give your money to a professional and let them invest your money
2025-07-31,"If you’re an investor, who cares about the daily swings. Think bigger friend. We are at the beginning stages of an AI revolution. AI is bigger than the automobile being built, the Industrial Revolution, the internet, and everything else that has ever happened. And NVIDIA owns the market. It will approach $200 pps as we get closer to earnings. We are just getting started."
2025-07-31,"You already know why it’s a bad idea to YOLO all that cash.  A 1% or 2% fluctuation in any stock is nothing. Try using a 10% stop loss and scaling in with a way smaller position, like $10k divided into five parts invested every two months, instead of $100k all at once. (Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and for entertainment purposes only, yadda yadda)"
2025-07-31,"my average is 120 and i'm not investing any more unless it drops significantly, just putting funds into AI ETF till that happens, it has NVDA holdings anyway"
2025-07-31,"NVDA is not a stock for tiny stop losses, really I wouldn't ever use a stop loss on NVDA. 

Less some massive catalyst that would be all over ""the news"" NVDA is always trending up."
2025-07-31,Very dumb move take that from an experienced trader it’s very seldom a good idea to buy anything at ATH and there are much better stocks with faster better growth you can put your money into that are not at ATH I’ll give one example carvana great growth stocks
2025-07-31,Buy high sell low. Do it
2025-07-31,"Take profit, wait for big boi dip"
2025-07-31,"It's a terrible idea.

NVDA is a great stock, and we're in a powerful bull market, no question about that. It may well go to 200 before any significant pullback. Or, we can have a big red candle tomorrow with a 5% haircut. Nobody knows when or how this rally is going to end.

No argument if you want to start investing with DCA. However, YOLO into an overheated stock in an overheated market at your own *significant* *risk.*

I also see a lot more of these types of posts lately, which to me is a contrarian indicator."
2025-07-31,"Orders with stop losses are visible to market makers. They know where the liquidity is and will hunt for your order or more exactly it will go up and down to execute both long and short positions. If you want to play it, you have to play it without a stop loss. But then... without a stop loss, your position will decrease sharper if you do not watch it. So no matter what you do, your chances to lose money on this are high.

Nvidia has a potential of 20-30% up, maybe 50% if everyone FOMO at earnings, but it's extremely vulnerable to geopolitical shocks, so potential downwards is 10x. At this point in the market, it might be safer to choose a company that is having a bigger upward swing potential and a lower downward swing potential and its less vulnerable to geopolitical shocks. Bottom line, if you are in, good luck! If not, maybe consider keep some money aside if you do not have ideas for shopping. A correction might come. Even if 10%, it might still be a good opportunity."
2025-08-01,"Tomorrow may be red but I’m pretty sure everyone is on the same page, nvda is going to 200. See if there’s a dip tomorrow. Buy in and look away"
2025-08-01,It will be $200 per soon.
2025-08-01,"6.8% to 8.8% stop loss: Your stops are too tight. Keep in mind Nvidia; the market makers love to clean out the stops. You just gotta have balls and hold; every time there’s a big sweep, the next day she pops, the market makers will drop it there to clean out all the stops. They love doing that shit. You know how hard it is to find Nvidia shares."
2025-08-01,If you’re gunna sell at 1% at least make it covered calls?
2025-08-01,"Id just not set stop loss unless its like 5%~. The market will always dip. Like today, i think it was at 171. Thats when ya wanna buy more. Cause its already gone up to about 175. The market has been dipping every Friday for the last couple weeks pretty bad. Then they ride all week. Just dont get too worried. Just pump and ride. Easiest way, otherwise you'll over analyze Every market move. 

If your trading and/or this your full time job, then fuck that advice above. But if you a regular dude like me, best to just buy dips and invest slowly. You'll miss more timing the market than just slowly buying over time. (NOT EVERY TIME OBV). but a good principle to live by"
2025-08-02,"You may want to research and learn,read at least a post or two before asking a very silly question,start with square one investing 101"
2025-08-02,"Do not put your cash all into NVDA. Diversify at least a little. A third in NVDA, a third into an SP500 ETF, and a quarter in another growth stock or even a safe dividend stock. The rest keep that cash either in a HYSA or even a bond. If you’re gonna invest, one thing to do (even though sometimes it does pay off) is not putting all your eggs in one basket"
2025-08-03,"I’m a trader, we use stop losses. You sound like you are wanting to buy a hold a while. If you like the company, buy it and hold.  If you want to trade, I highly advise not to trade a % stop.  Put you stop under the most relevant higher low on the daily chart if you want this as an investment, under the most relevant higher low on the 30min if you want a swing, underneath the most  relevant higher low on the 5min chart if you want a day trade.  Those are estimates, what you want is a valid support area, with your stop under that."
2025-08-03,"A 1% or 2% stop loss?

I don't put a stop loss on stocks that I believe in. I watched this stock drop 50% or more on a couple of occasions and I'm up 3300% since I first bought in. 

  
Stop loss...I bought QBTS last year at .77 cents a share. It popped when Google announced a break-through. It kept climbing to about 10.20 or so. I kept the stop loss about 12% below. It ended up triggering after a gain of about 40K. Did the same thing again when it went back down to 3.80 because Jensen said we were years away. Put that 40K back into it and it ran up and my stop loss triggered at like 15.75. I missed out on some gains both times, but... I don't believe in it.

  
NVDA, TSM, AMZN, META, MSFT...=no stop losses. 

SMCI when it short squeezed earlier this year, I had a stop loss. Sold at 55. Missed the top by about 20%. 

  
But you put a 1% or 2% stop loss on NVDA... you're gonna trigger it every day. Even on a day it's up 5%, it's usually dropping 1% at some point, often earlier in the morning, but hell, even later in the afternoon(not that your stop loss would trigger than, but my point is, your stop loss is going to trigger nearly every day). 

  
You will ONLY end up with losses with a stop loss that tight."
2025-07-31,"Its a bad time because you sold. When it drops 10% don't just dump it, be patient."
2025-07-31,"Oh, that's where it's been sitting the whole time. I want to make use of bull market.
The only thing that bothers me is what are future events that people anticipate would impact their position and kind of know an exit plan.
For me, I'm only able to now and can't forecast anything dor shit.
Its literally like, buy and pray it doesn't crash."
2025-08-01,Pretty sure there’s a lot MORE than one person who lost money on Nvidia. It was trading flat for an entire year in 2024. Deepseek came out and Nvidia tanked almost 20 percent. Bet there was a lot of panic selling.
2025-07-31,"I agree with you. This is pure FOMO and taking action on emotion. I have done this in the past, with FOMO on Nvidia and ended up with $5k lost. Pretty much all this year. This time, I might repeat my same mistake again OR this time is different.

From discussion I have encountered here, there really isn't any major event in the foreseeable future to make this stock tank. It has to go up. Unless some black swan event happens like next COVID or something, this stock has to go up. $190 as another commenter here. The only strategy I can think of is buy again and set trailing loss to 2%?"
2025-08-01,"Yes, there as a dip and red day. I can't believe it I again bought it at high. Christ."
2025-08-01,I don't own any shares to do covered calls. I don't want to risk naked calls
2025-08-01,I did 2 percent at 180. I'm in red again. Jesus.
2025-07-31,Nvidia was $89.  4 months ago.  And you're still apprehensive at $190?  I don't think you're cut out for this and should probably hand over the keys to the castle and forget about it for 20 years.
2025-07-31,My only problem is I didn't buy enough nvdl in april
2025-07-31,"Factually incorrect.

You've never heard someone describe something bad and then say that they actually made out in the long run?!?

Envision having a large amount of stock sell when you weren't expecting .. 

That gets reported to the IRS.  They don't care you had it since 2019 and a stop sell accidentally triggered.  

You pay the piper when he comes knocking

Or how about a car accident... Someone t-bones your 2004... You get pay out + pain suffering etc... you buy a 2024

You got screwed.

You made out better in the long run.   New car more money and hopefully no permanent damage."
2025-07-31,"I'm just saying think about it before acting. Run numbers to see if buying now makes any sense. Personally, Every time i see this many post about a stock it makes me hold cash because i know what's coming next."
2025-07-31,"If you believe in the company why set a stop loss?  2% is just jitters.  You might get stopped out on that this week no problem.  Buy in with a 5 year vision, that will keep you from selling if it drops 2%.  Don't buy in if you're going to sell if it drops 2%."
2025-07-31,"Investors for the most part like to lock in gains after 3-5% gain on stock price. It has happened to Nvidia, Broadcom cloud flare and every other big stock. 

I wish they would just let it ride for 10% gains before taking profits, but that's just how it goes. 

I could be wrong, but it happens wayyy too often when stocks hit ATH after a breakout."
2025-08-01,"If you need to turn a quick dollar, you’ve got the wrong idea buying shares to hold. 

Even if it’s dipping atm it’s not going to collapse, the trajectory is still upwards. 

If you need a quick buck go to Vegas, discover the option market or look at a short squeeze. High risk, high reward."
2025-08-01,Just buy puts at this point
2025-07-31,META and MSFT are both up 8-10% in AH after earnings. Nvidia up $4 in AH. Tomorrow’s going to be fun!!!
2025-08-01,"why, people here said it will be $190 in no time and free money. I legit though that.   
now i'm in a position to sell or suck it in. honestly, i'll just sell for now to cut my losses. no idea how far down it will,

actually, do you know why its tanking ? earning come out in august tho"
2025-07-31,Up $5.63 @ 9:07 pm central time.
2025-07-31,"Yup tomorrow will be more than likely a very red day, because everyone will be selling off to lock in profits. Then maybe Friday or Monday we will come roaring back."
2025-07-31,Microsoft is notorious for always beating earnings (they have done it the last 12 Qs) shooting up in value then crashing 1-3% the next day because of investors locking in profits. It always goes back up pretty quickly.
2025-08-03,"Sounds good, short bus"
2025-07-31,Buy more NVDA bullish 🚀
2025-07-31,If google can get some good news it will hit get there.
2025-08-02,7T is fair value
2025-07-31,Sick gains brother!... IMO - Take those gains whenever you can and invest in shares instead.
2025-07-31,You still have $150 sitting on the sideline being unproductive
2025-07-31,Well life is too short and expensive to afford to wait 30 years in an index to be a millionaire
2025-08-01,Sell tomorrow?
2025-08-01,"Hell yea. NVDA lowkey the new amazon. I would assume you have other options invested, but good shit fam. Just keep on buying and holding. At this rate we hitting over 200 this year."
2025-08-01,I always wonder why people buy several different calls almost at the same strike for the same expiration date. Is there a good reason to buy both $170 and $175 and not just twice the amount of one of them?
2025-08-02,How bout you buy some puts for protection in case it comes crashing down? Ur almost at a mill so 10-20k of insurance wont hurt
2025-08-02,Don’t sell
2025-08-03,Hope you took profits because come next week the market doesn’t look too good
2025-07-31,I mean it was 50/50 🤣 was either gonna pump or dump on this mornings earnings
2025-08-03,VOO is a great ETF with a good dividend too. Owned it for years!

2025-08-02,"Do the positions themselves not explain why?

What are you actually asking?

""Is there a good reason to buy both...""

Oh jeez I don't know, do you know for sure if it's going to be $170 or $175? No? According to you guess we better make an assumption and put it all in one strike, because yeah 🤷‍♂️

Does that sound logical or reasonable to you because this is exactly what you sound like asking the question...?"
2025-08-03,Set and forget and sleep good at night
2025-09-30,"wow, that must be a great \~$2 gain! not counting howmuch you've lost on theta :D"
2025-08-05,"Well since you but them 2 months out I'm assuming you are not targeting a direct ""hit"" on your strike, but probably a fair bit above. So I'd argue that having 160 & 165 calls or having 2x160 calls is almost the same given a scenario (which I'm guessing you are going for) where the price ends up in the 180-200s. 

Was simply wondering if there's any specific risk management strategy to it, or just shear indecisiveness.

Sounds like the latter."
2025-07-31,I’m holding till 2060
2025-07-31,"Whooooo carez!   Are you invested for next week or 20 years from now?

If it goes down, buy more and never sell..."
2025-07-31,"10% could happen any time it’s normal, but I doubt we see much up or down until earnings. If it drifts down 5-7% I wouldn’t read anything into it. Assess what to do about earnings the day or two before."
2025-07-31,"The other Mag 7 companies are realising what AI can do for them so they are buying even more chips.  All the other companies and countries will be FOMOing and will pile in.  $4 trillion company will amazingly become the first $5 trillion company.  

Don’t forget the companies that help build the data centers and solve the energy need dilemmas."
2025-07-31,"Depends on what you get something for. Anyone with a brain has been investing in nvidia for probably at least 2 years off and on depending on how you trade it. Nvidia is a beast and even the smartest money guys have been wrong about this stock. Some people can’t envision a world with a glass dome, Stargate, or complete revamp of our infrastructures with AI. I can so I held."
2025-07-31,"Dollar value goes down, thats why"
2025-07-31,"Nowadays the market is really just gambling for retail investors. Sure, it helps to know fundamentals and it helps to know about how the company is run and about the various forces that shape the market.

But in the end, you have a fairly small cadre of large money houses who are able to play the market both ways, up or down, and actively work to manipulate the market to enrich themselves at the expense of others, and a mass of retail investors who appear, nowadays, to invest mostly for the rush. It isn't even emotional...it's more like addictive gambling.

Somewhere in the midst of all this are a few people actually looking to make some money by investing in companies that they believe are going to be successful.

It tells you all you need to know that Warren Buffet has taken as much money OUT of the market as he has right now, and currently shows no interest in buying anything."
2025-07-31,"But 10% down at this point would be around 162. I’m sure the stockholders don’t care, but those holding options will be really screwed !"
2025-07-31,"What I heard in July last year too when it hit 142 and how it will never, ever possibly go under 100 again. 200 end of year, etc etc. We will see how things turn out but if you want an example how sensitive the market is to disruptive news, remember deepseek, and how that shitty LLM caused Nvidia to tank around 30% .


I'll bide my time."
2025-07-31,"Yeah, just like the internet, when will people learn? Technology has been at a standstill for decades obviously and it will continue to stagnate, ever hear of the dot com bubble? Hahah imagine the morons thinking people want to buy books online… like hello? The book store and picking up the book is an experience, what’s next buy shoes online? LOL can you believe these tech bros? Complete failure!"
2025-08-01,"Of course we can. And I apologize. I just can’t understand why so many seem to be rooting for things to fail or stocks to go down. That doesn’t even make sense. 

I’m sure most of them just want to be able to blame it on Trump. A lot more buying than selling right now. Let’s enjoy making money together instead of rooting against it"
2025-07-31,Nobody carezzz about quality. It's might dollar and mass produce for max profit...
2025-07-31,"Everyone was mocking him but now he looks like a genius with his 7,000 shares 😂"
2025-07-31,I think Meta up $77 after hours is dragging NVDA along with it as well as Microsoft.
2025-07-31,"wel... NVDA @ $175 =/= AMD @ $175. NVDA is a $4T market cap company. AMD is under $300B. 

I own both, far less AMD. I bought it because AMD is crushing INTC, not because I expect them to rival NVDA. Though I do expect them to have a share of the AI market, which is necessary as NVDA cannot meet the global demand alone. 

Do I think NVDA hits $200 before AMD? I could see it, especially if they crush earnings. But does it matter? No. They will both cross $200 at some point, probably before the end of 2025."
2025-07-31,Not sure why crossing 200$ is a metric to track.  Their market cap valuations are very different.  Share price is just share price. I guess you are saying NVDA will go up 12.5 percent before amd does.  Perhaps.
2025-07-31,I think AMD will get to $200 before NVDA
2025-07-31,I like your analysis but comparing stocks on their share price instead of  market cap is weird.
2025-07-31,"I actually sold 400 shares at $150 to increase my cash, actually MM fund, to around $90k. Still holding the rest, 2500 shares @ a $136.49 cost basis, until after the earnings report. TSMC just said that they got an order for 300,000 chips for NVDA H20 chips for the China market. I think the call after earnings could go south if they say that re-entry into China is going to be delayed. TSMC had reallocated wafer production to other companies after NVDA stopped buying the H20 silicone. The big thing about holding NVDA is that my portfolio was down $120k when they dropped to $86 in April and now that has reversed and I am up $105k, including the profit from the 400 shares sold."
2025-07-31,Do not care. Holding both
2025-07-30,I hold both AMD and NVIDIA but I only hold AMD because of their CPUs. NVIDIA is the graphics and AI leader. It's not even a contest.
2025-07-31,Nvidia at $200 in 2025!
2025-07-31,Another investor with hole in the butt
2025-08-01,"I totally get where you’re coming from with NVDA – the ecosystem lock-in is real, and they’ve pretty much built the highway for AI development. If you're holding long-term, Tiger Brokers' Cash Boost Account could be worth checking out. It’s a good option if you’re holding onto stocks like NVDA and want to earn a bit of interest while waiting for the next big run."
2025-07-31,"\> The hyperscaler spending is insane too. Microsoft just announced they're spending like $80B on capex this year.

I believe that $80B in CapEx spending by MSFT is for its FY25, which ended on June 30. New numbers might be announced after the closing bell today when their earnings are announced and the company provides initial thoughts on their FY26 earnings, revenue, and spend plus product launches."

2025-07-31,NVDA already split last year. so i don't see how its even a competition between the stock prices. It's like the F1 champion already doing a double lap on you..
2025-07-31,"dollar value on both stock doesn't mean anything. NVDA had multiple splits at least 3 in the past 10 years. So dollar value on NVDA should be around $2500 or so.

Adjust for the 10-for-1 split in 2024: 112.50×10=1125

Adjust for the 4-for-1 split in 2021: 1125×4=4500

AMD on the other hand in past 10 year no split and still below $200. That should give you some numbers to compare."
2025-07-31,The only thing left is understanding the price and the amount of shares they have among many other things that won't get into as you're comparing apples with melons
2025-07-31,"<BIASED AMD DUDE>

For me the Vendor Lockin Argument isnt such a huge Deal. Its not Consumer Based like Apple or MSFT, indeed the most critical Stuff is hosted on Linux for a good reason. We are talking about big Companies that have the resources to switch in a matter of time if they can save some money. More important: Companys dont like getting locked in, even if there Product does. Last but not least, Open Source is a massive Argument for tweaks.

  
</BIASED AMD DUDE>"
2025-07-31,"It doesn’t matter who got past $200 first. Both will.

AMD to me is the “leftover” company. During CPU war, AMD caught the leftover market share from Intel. 

Then in GPU time, again AMD played the leftover role behind NVDA. 

Now AI boom, AMD is still catching the leftover market share which NVDA can’t meet demand."
2025-07-31,"Agreed this is not an equal comparison: NVDA would need to add the equivalent of *two* AMDs in terms of market cap to hit $200 / share, whereas AMD only needs to add $41B to its market cap. 

Also, who cares which stock hits $200 first? Just let them both keep creating great technology that is increasingly powering the world's newly transformed economy."
2025-07-31,"Yeah, I'm getting SOOO sick of this shit.

I got shit on here because I said I was buying AMD and I thought they were going to out-perform NVDA in the next 2-3 years.

Now... without sounding obnoxious, I bought 1500 shares of NVDA in 2020(5.70 DCA after the two splits) and another 1000 at \~400 in Sept of '23(so 40 a share).

NVDA change my life.

That said... when AMD was at 78 a share, I told people...they should buy AMD. I bought 5000 shares and literally had a Mod just trashing me.

Hell, I also bought 4750 of AVGO and 7,000 shares of AMD. My portfolio now is NVDA, TSM, AMZN, AVGO, AMD, META and then other smaller investments like SMCI. 

NVDA is more dominant. That's not in question. AMD has a FAR easier path to doubling and tripling in the next 3 years than NVDA does. AMD will hit 1T market cap before NVDA will hit a 13T market cap(roughly 3X for each).

  
But I don't get why people don't understand ALL these companies are going to grow from AI. When you're worth 4.5 TRILLION, it's a whole HELLUVA lot more difficult to double than if you're a 270B company."

2025-07-31,"Bullshit. AMD has a good product and they've been selling to the Hyperscalers for years. 

It has nothing to do with NVDA, AMD has a good product and when Trump announced the CapEx in SA, the UAE... AMD sold just as much as NVDA. That was a MASSIVE boost to AMD. A new 20B dollar investment when they're currently guiding for 7.1B to 7.8B...

  
AMD is booming for SUCH a simple reason that people who are ONLY invested in NVDA for some baffling reason can't grasp.

THE ENTIRE WORLD IS BEING BUILT ON AI. 

AMD isn't some shitty little company. It's an extremely well run company. It was just well behind NVDA to market with their GPUs and NVDA has been dominant ever sense.

  
But suggesting it's ONE or the OTHER is like saying you can only own COST or WLMT. It's insane."
2025-07-31,"Not OP, but AMD is like jack of all trades. There would always be a room for competition if NVDA keeps raising price and AMD can match or perform better. AMD vs Intel, AMD vs NVDA. They might have to keep an eye on ARM though. That market might end up devouring CPU markets."
2025-07-31,"it's not going to go down, but it's definitely going to slow down from a percentage standpoint. I don't think we're going to see $2 trillion in datacenter revenue in 2027 or even 2028. Maybe when they figure out how to make truly AI enabled robots and self driving cars at scale."
2025-07-31,"Hardly a true competitor.   NVDA has been eating their lunch since AMD entered the graphic card space in 2006.   

The only real hope they have is when they release MI400 expected in 2026.

Even then - I'm not really sure anyone who has already stocked up heavy with NVDA is gonna switch their entire ecosphere to AMD.   They could augment a few here or there sure... But it will be no different than the graphics card where NVDA has owned a 90% slice of that pie.   I don't expect their next release to suddenly make NVDAs knees wobble."
2025-07-31,"Time will robe you wrong, maybe you missed the 3 odd billion oracle ordered from them for the MI350. Not something to just ignore"

2025-07-31,"At this point, sky's the limit. Heck, we don't even know when it's going to find resistance again.

For the first time in a long while, I think we're all actually LOOKING FORWARD to the market reaction to the next quarterly."

2025-08-02,"It would put me in a position of having a larger holding of the stock, and my hope would be that the stock goes back to the price prior to the split, if not higher. I’m holding Nvidia until I retire in 40 years, if it splits and shoots back up to where it is today or higher, more monies for me."
2025-07-31,"How does the split affect shareholders? if you can explain, do you just get allocated more relative to the number you owned prior the split"
2025-07-30,"In 50 years $40T no doubt.

2025-07-30,"It's very useful in its current state already. I don't have any engineer colleague that doesn't use it, I know researchers that use it and dumb people even use it blindly for dumb shit.

2025-07-30,"You're correct that current MLA models aren't truly sentient but you miscalculate human sentience as well.  It is bounded by time, biology, and sensory limitations.  If machines reach or exceed the functional boundaries of human reasoning and perception, then even without ""true"" consciousness they will operate at or beyond what humans require to interact meaningfully with the world and our definition of thought will also no longer apply meaningfully."
2025-07-31,"Say Nvidia does another split when it reaches 500, and they do a 10 for 1. For every 1 share you own, they will replace it with 10, but the stock will go from 500 to 50. So 1 old stock and 10 new stocks both equal $500.

It isn't as necessary now, since many/most brokerages allow fractional shares, but the old argument used to be doing splits made shares of more expensive stocks *more affordable* for more people. Not as many people could buy 1 share of a $600 stock, but they could buy a couple shares if it was split to $60."
2025-07-31,"That's what I thought, so there's real no monetary benefit for the holder right? I saw a comment earlier saying ""ohhh that would be great if it split again"" thinking they would get more returns or something."
2025-08-04,"psychological factor. 'oh price is lower and i get more.'
even though value is same.  more people will buyin, driving up the value even more"
2025-07-31,"Correct, there is no benefit to a stock holder other than the fact that *1 share* is cheaper, so you could purchase whole shares more often.

Your stock portfolio will be the exact same at the end of day before a split as it is the end of day after the split (minus the actual stocks performance that day)."
2025-08-01,It does nothing to a shareholder except dilutes the number of total shares. The shareholder gets more shares that are worth less per share. Quite often the stock price goes down after the split.
2025-08-05,"Just so we’re clear the stock prices historically doesn’t go up after the stock splits. It’s about 50/50, including market fluctuations. 
Just because a stock price is lower doesn’t mean it’s cheaper."

2025-07-30,"The dot com bubble wasn’t due to the internet not being an absolute game changer. It was due to the market not being able to accurately price and predict which companies would become successful businesses. AI can be a total game changer, and we could still see an epic AI bubble that pops. All it takes is for people to buy based on hype and speculation, driving prices of certain assets way beyond the fundamentals of the business. When I look at some of the PE ratios today (PLTR, TSLA) it boggles my mind that there are people that cannot see that paying so much for a business that doesn’t make money is crazy. Maybe some of those companies will find a way to translate hype into real business success, but if not, it only takes a few big companies collapsing to bring the market crashing with them. The good businesses will survive and thrive and the others will crash and burn."
2025-07-30,No one knows what tomorrow holds.
2025-07-30,"Agree, only thing is that we don't know where the tangible potential of A.I lies and if it will plateu - how much it will keep transforming like automobiles did. Whilst A.I is growing and has valid use cases there is still a lot of pushing it into things for marketing and fear of rivals winning the race. which is good for investors for now anyway."
2025-07-30,"I do think there's an AI crash in the near term.

There is data to back up the thesis that the current AI sector public equity valuations are much too high.

Not all the use cases, infrastructure build plans and downstream investments (from Nvidia) in AI are going to pan out and bear fruit.  

Though NVDA will weather the inevitable AI bubble crash, it may experience a drop in the share price.  

When the water recedes, all boats are lowered."
2025-07-30,"Look at the amount of businesses showing up, trying to make the fundamental technology do something stupid and thinking they’re gonna make $1 billion from it.

If I get another person on the real estate forums saying that they are here to revolutionize what we’re doing with AI, just give them a few ideas I will strangle them. 

The similarity is that people are using the word A"
2025-07-30,"I definitely see the parallels.

The .com crash was inevitable. VC money isn’t infinite and eventually VC firms will want to see profits. When that doesn’t happen you see the startup shut down.

The same here. If OpenAI and Alexa can’t profit from AI then both get shut down. obviously Amazon will survive but maybe not Alexa. 

Companies like Apple or Microsoft that integrate AI into their products will still see the benefits of AI, but many will not:

[https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/](https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/)

Anysphere will die because Apple and Microsoft will integrate AI into their development tools

Mercor will likely die because Workday and ServiceNow will integrate AI into their workflows

Thinking Machine Labs is literally all hype

World Labs might be bought by Apple, NVIDIA, or Google, but itself as a standalone company isn’t likely to survive

You can walk the whole list and easily imagine most of them dead in five years because an existing company can recreate their product or service, or because the idea is stupid"
2025-07-30,"There is a bubble for sure and a lot of companies will fail. The major difference between this and the Dot Com bubble, however, is that the majority of AI startups and AI-first companies are privately owned. Therefore, your average investor won’t feel the direct effects of the bubble bursting, only some of the minor ripple effects. 

As for NVDA, it may halve in value but will ultimately rebound. Remember the DeepSeek scare and how the market, for some unfathomable reason, thought there no longer was a need for Nvidia GPUs… Something similar may happen, but this time the ripple effect will first and foremost hurt the insitutional AI startup investors. The second order effect will be the cloud and AI datacenter providers due to a temporary dip in compute demans. NVDA will only get the 3rd order effect. 

Trust me, the main players making money off of AI are private institutional investors… We are unable to participate in this feast. On the other hand, we won’t get hurt when the music starts playing."
2025-07-30,"It’s really a continuous technology innovation curve, with markets lagging in their recognition of the economic discontinuities.

I used to advise CEOs about these inevitable changes from globally interlinked computers and a constant increase of computing power to enable them.  I was coding AI at university for one of the worlds leaders in that field and my lab partner in the early 80s is currently at an AI leader but has been working on this since for decades as one of their thought leaders.

Usually the social sciences lag what technology is going to do to change lives, as even most of my CEO clients failed to act or even take my papers and advice seriously.  apple did, as did Microsoft.

Anyway, I disagree with your hot take.  All sorts of legal and social issues, not to mention things like war can kill economic booms promptly.  We don’t know how the future will be reflected in markets.  But the cash flow La today justify the valuations and that is one advantage of NVDA vs many dot com busts.  Not every company of that era investing in the internet failed."
2025-07-30,You mean like the oversupply of overvalued startups brabbling about AI? Or the oversupply of LLMs which are all already interchangeable? Or something like OpenAI burning through money?
2025-07-30,"The dot com bubble was the commercialization of the internet.  Business was completely altered during that decade.  Both how existing businesses operated and new models that changed entire industries.  

You are completely under valuing the disruption.  Just 1 simple example is that you couldn't call outside of about a 20 miles radius without it costing 8 cents a minute."
2025-07-31,"There is no comparison, dot.com era was stupid people investing in anything that had a .com at the end of their company regardless of the fundamentals.  AI is definitely becoming a revolution in this world."
2025-07-31,If your business model is based on “looks” and “clicks” and “downloads” it’s garbage.  I invest in companies that make physical products that a lot of people want to buy.  HUGE difference.
2025-07-31,"For there to be a bubble style crash this time around, there has to be a couple of years where the stocks rise like crazy like they did in 98/99. So we’re talking NASDAQ going from 20,000 to 60,000 in a couple of years, and then to crash all the way back down to 12,000 to 15,000. At the moment the stocks have risen nicely but not bubble levels. If there was a crash today and stocks went down they may crash down to 12,000 to 15,000 but that wouldn’t be a bubble crash, that would just be a big market correction and most people could weather that correction. There’s no way the market crashes way below that because earnings are really solid and a market of at least 16,000 is well justified. Of course you could see a greater crash but there would have to be other catalysts such as a world war or a Great Depression, but that wouldn’t equate to a DotCom bubble where the crash was simply due to overvaluation."
2025-07-30,I mean it’s not the same you’re right because AI really could transform our world into something we’ve never seen. But let’s say it ends up being negative like how it could replace so many jobs it leaves us with an abnormally high unemployment rate. Not enough people consuming and much more unemployed people it could be bad. AI could collapse universities or at least a good portion of them. Wealth can be so concentrated to the 1% we basically just become slaves to them (we kind of are but to a much greater extent)
2025-07-30,This! Anything with .com was flying high with no earnings and no way to evaluate them
2025-07-31,This is true however your stating this as if there more like apple. These companies will slow in valuation whilst their revenue increases much greater than bigger companies. In other words they will likely grow into this lowering there P/E ratio.
2025-07-30,"There we had pets.com and here we have absolute behemoths (Microsoft, meta, amazon…) investing heavily but the difference is today’s investments don’t go anywhere, Microsoft, meta and amazon will be juuuuuust fine"
2025-07-30,"PE is just one metric and absolutely, Tesla could become the biggest company in the world someday. My point is that the bubble popping is when everyone realizes something baked into asset prices is fundamentally flawed. Maybe every company that isn’t earning the money today that their stock price suggests will ultimately grow so much that they justify the price. Maybe we will have a bubble pop. Who knows. With new things like AI though, there is a good chance people misjudge certain things about the future value of a company. When they happens in an extreme way, it can cause a big repricing event that creates waves throughout the market. 

I was just using Tesla as an example because there is an enormous amount of future performance expectations built into the price. If they went down, they would create a lot of chaos in the market."
2025-07-30,"That's exactly why there are bubbles.  Valuations didn't matter, just the story of what companies were going to become.  How big the market opportunity was for their product.  

Then, suddenly, they mattered.  Amazon never missed a quarter.  Continuously met, grew and increased revenue.  And went down \~96%"
2025-07-30,Agreed on your great points. Most peeps invest in the future earnings and cashflows. It all comes down to your convictions in the stock and how long your investment horizon is
2025-07-30,What feels like a bubble is that the existing compute platform is changing. Data centers made up primarily of CPU based compute are becoming obsolete in many workloads. Seeing the benefits of GPU based compute many hyperscalers are refitting and building new infrastructure to support the shift. This isn’t just about AI chatbots these GPU servers have a huge number of uses. The cost of building out the infrastructure to support this shift is in the trillions. What you’re seeing with a company like Nvidia is a unique situation where one company has most of the critical technology and software needed for that shift. Of course Nvidia needs to keep innovating and stay ahead but this is not the same as the dot com era. Open AI yes is losing billions because they are heavily investing in the future. But they are also already making billions. They are not the pets.com and Nvidia is not the Cisco of the AI era.
2025-07-29,The holding is strong and powerful!!
2025-07-31,You people are stupid can't answer simple question You have to be retarded probably only invested in AMC in GameStop and lost a lot of money
2025-07-31,I would suggest to add on red days if you can every few weeks.
2025-07-30,All time has was $1000 before the split my friend
2025-07-31,"In your position, I'd be selling, not buying, a call.  If you sell and roll a single covered call, you can use the income to continue to increase your share count.  This year, I've been rolling a covered call on NVDA.  Every time I sell a new contract, I buy another share.

In 2025 (edited to correct date), I have generated $2051 income selling options and spent $2019 to buy 15 shares.  So I'm up $32 and 15 shares.

You risk having 100 shares called away at your chosen strike price.  If that happens you can just take the profits, wheel the position and start selling cash secured puts.  Use the income from the puts to continue to pay for more shares.

It's a lot less risky than buying calls.  You can lose 100% of your premium if the share price turns against you."
2025-07-29,Duh no one is saying AMD could dethrone NVDA. But AMd has lots of room to grow. At least it could go to $1 trillion. That's about 4x
2025-07-29,"The AMD fanboys are delusional. A few months ago it was so bad on here that you couldn't recommend a PC build with NVIDIA, without 10-20 fanboys jumping in saying AMD is better. 


NVIDIA is the industry leader in graphics and AI, and will continue to be. Obviously there is validity to AMD's CPU products.  "
2025-07-29,"I think they've come to the realization that AMD's not the next Nvidia, but I still see people there calling AMD a trillion dollar company, even heard it called a Buffet stock once.

I'm a shareholder, but I had to unsub from that place. It's really a cult where any bad news is considered a ""hit piece"" or ""FUD"" or market manipulation, and God-forbid you criticize the CEO and board. Any analyst who downgrades is a moron; any who upgrades is a genius.

That cult mentality led me to become a bagholder multiple times, plus I didn't get into Nvidia until $22. All stock subs are kind of bad, but AMD, INTC and SMCI especially."
2025-07-29,"AMD has some merits. While today they are 2% of AI deliveries we should wait for tge next 3 quarters that will make or break AMD.

AMD has the potential to touch 1T..however that means high margins, high revenue. I don't know where they can get it since nvda has preorders and capacity bought till end of 2026.

So either they bring something strong to the table or they remain in the cpu and consumer graphix market"
2025-07-29,"AMD and NVDA, while selling very similar products in the same market to largely the same type of customers, are not in a position to ever ""dethrone"" the other, the way the market is right now. They will both grow a lot due to the growing need for both. It is impossible for nvda to be the only supplier for AI industry. AMD is already better at catering to gamers and other PC users.      

Both will grow a lot as the market grows and matures. They both have their strengths. Whoever fanboys a ticker for any reason is pretty fucking stupid. If you avoid potential investments due to branding, you are just lucky if you make any money. AMD is gonna soar. Nvda is gonna soar. Until something new completely changes the market, this will be true for both."
2025-07-29,"There will be many ups and downs before June 2027. There are better ways to profit than passively holding. Most importantly, don't forget to buy more shares when the price is good. Good luck!!"
2025-07-30,"I've been saying all along I'm now up 324%  .....nothing can hurt my position nOw.  Not Trump, not Amd, not fake Chinese AI companies. And not FUD .....BRING IT."

2025-07-30,Yeah so he can short duh.
2025-07-29,He’s saying to sell and to buy back when the “price is good”. Get out bear
2025-07-29,"Maybe, but I’m not broke like you anymore, man 🥹. Hit me up when you turn that $85,000 investment into a 75% gain. I’m not interested in seeing your $3,000 investments—keep those to yourself."
2025-07-30,Dude if you think one single dude is sitting out there to short some dude in his mom’s basement’s long position.  You are not understanding how shorts work.  Chat GPT that stuff man.  So much information out there.
2025-07-29,There will be ups and downs over the next year. Most important is that you buy the downs. Best is if you can use a bigger part of the toolbox including options

2025-07-29,"You cannot compare the dot-com bubble to AI, and the main reason why is because companies are actually proving to gain revenue from AI."
2025-07-29,"If I remember correctly, back in the Dot Com bubble it was unprofitable companies, which is the total opposite right now."
2025-07-29,"Dot com was paper cash.  Fake money.  All those IPOs generated paper money until someone pulled the thread and the whole thing unraveled.   No one was making a profit... They were just trying to be first with a website /  e-commerce presence.

That is not today.  By a stretch."
2025-07-29,The Dot com crash is a mythical story.  The reality is there were winners and losers.  GOOG and MSFT for instance have been around since dot com and are winners.  AI is already profitable.  Speculating on NVTS for instance could be a crash but it’s a speculative buy.  NVDA and AMD are investing - not speculative.
2025-07-29,"Nah, deep learning will continue improving. Maybe future LLMs are going to be diffusion-models, reducing the computational cost, allowing to train better models. Moreover, the new approach Flow-Matching also has a lot of potential for the coming models. 

On the other hand, there's still a lot of research and application to do with Reinforcement Learning, technology behind AlphaGo, AlphaFold and even ChatGPT with RLHF.

Now, for Multimodal models, which incorporate vision, audio and language it's also just the beginning.

All these models require Nvidia GPUs, either if the models become more expensive, or more efficient at the point that we can't tin all of them on our phones.

And what about the applications of generative models in medicine? We have AlphaFold yes, but there's still a long road to go. This barely is the beginning."
2025-07-29,"You have big tech, your NVDA etc posting mega earnings but at the same time you are seeing the rise of small cap AI companies, no revenue and vague solutions for nonexistant problems etc.

  
Most likely if a crash occurs it will be due to a external cause somewhere else in the financial system. Takes all these companies down and will be dubbed the AI crash. But big tech will come out as winners.

  
You always have winners and losers and a bunch of capital will be burned by the losers."
2025-07-29,"There are a lot of “AI” companies that will undoubtedly go under, mainly because they don’t have a profitable business model, so it is similar in that way. However, Nvidia is obviously not one of them as they have the most profitable business model that we’ve seen."
2025-07-29,"The Dot Com bubble has a few similarities with the AI boom,  but in the end I would be very careful to conclude that they will also share the same outcome. In both cases, a key technology was in stake, associated with ridiculously high expectations. For the internet, those expectations basically came true, because it is indeed the center of our global infrastructure and multi-billion dollar markets evolved in it. However, most of the companies from the dot dom bubble are gone, because they never really had a working business model. Many companies just slapped „.com“ to their names and watched their stock price explode (that’s obviously the origin of the crisis name). Many actually working companies corrected harshly in the process of the bursting bubble, because of panic and lost trust, but as we know they recovered. 

With AI, there are also very very high expectations priced in. NVIDIA is the most valuable company in the world, but without the extrapolation of further growth, quite far away from reaching the most revenue. Interestingly, many useless AI startups already vanished early in the hype, because many investors didn’t want to be fooled again. Even though many AI investments are still out of proportion for their respective gains, there ARE at least some gains and they scale. That’s another difference: profitable AI adoption is way smoother than the internet, because it can be distributed in the same way like many internet services before and the market already has experience with that. 

In the end, I think AI will cycle in harsh ups and downs, because of the pendulum between enthusiasm and realism, but in the end the industry and all its main players will survive and succeed. It will take us more years to reach AGI than promised, but even today’s AI is useful enough to rapidly automate and assist many tasks, so the productivity gain is still there. 
NVIDIA is now backed by the US government itself, has contracts with dozens of big companies and now with many other nations as well. The current valuation is high, so it will correct at some point in the next weeks and months, but in the end it will be back up."
2025-07-29,Gain revenue or improve efficiencies
2025-07-30,"It wasn’t just unprofitable companies, the big tech companies suffered losses too. Don’t forget there’s a bunch of companies now who don’t break even or barely make profit yet have high valuations, especially with AI. Isn’t coreweave not profitable yet?"
2025-08-04,Are ai companies profitable? Most are private and bleeding cash right
2025-07-30,"I don't understand the point you're trying to make. You're comparing the Internet today to the Internet of 2000 when it should be AI today to the Internet of 2000.

You mentioned in 2000 the adoption of the Internet was minimal vs today. That's essentially the same with AI. If it just disappeared today, it wouldn't change the majority of people's lives dramatically. Pretty sure in 25 years, AI will be ingrained into everything and impossible to live without. But that's not the case today."
2025-07-30,"Yeah but that’s kind of the point. The internet eventually lived up to the hype but many of those high flyers in that era never reached those stock prices again. Look at Cisco, it was and still is the backbone of the internet. It had the highest market cap in the world, never to reach close to those heights again. Their product became commoditized."
2025-08-04,"Is Nvidia profitable? Is Google, or Microsoft profitable?and even a shitty company like AMD is profitable."
2025-07-30,But if you bought Cisco at anytime except 1998-2001 you’ve done quite well on your investment.
2025-07-31,"Not exactly true. On October 7 2002, Cisco reached a post crash bottom of $8.12 per share, on this day the Dow Jones was 7,528. Since then, Cisco has gained 740% and the Dow Jones has gained 457%.

Of course the Nasdaq has performed better, but I only said you’ve done quite well on your investment, not the greatest investment."
2025-07-31,"From that same day SPY has returned 803%. Also that was Ciscos lowest day, it was a high flyer analogous to NVDA. I’d be nervous if I was an NVDA investor of a similar trajectory"
2025-07-29,"Nice move here.  Complement it with some NVDA option chains that have a high probability of success. NVDA will be running on a rampage for many more quarters as they try to get GPUs to customers and outfit the data centers. I love this company, their products and their stock is amazing and their leader is not only a great CEO but a great person too."
2025-07-30,Benefits of buy and hold
2025-07-30,"I crossed over 5400% today!! Bought at $3.20 per share. I don’t understand why anyone would sell after 50-100% returns 
Buy and hold 10-20 years!!!"
2025-07-30,What do you think is better to buy now Nvda or Amd?
2025-08-01,"I have 250 shares at $17 cost basis. Same regret, but I can’t complain"
2025-07-29,Why did you buy it at this specific moment in time?
2025-07-30,why did you only buy $2k+ worth of share? you can't get rich if you invest only so little money....
2025-07-31,"Agree. I bought 6/21/17 for $3.93/share. I sold some along the way. Regret it now. Had 12,000 shares (post splits). Started at 300 shares before splits."
2025-07-30,$NVDA has the sales to warrant their stock price tag.  AMD does not right now. The P/E for NVDA is 57 and the P/E for AMD is 130.  That’s a big difference.  Stay with NVIDIA it has the products everyone is trying to buy.
2025-07-29,"This is from a retirement account managed by a financial advisor, after I get some cash built up he’ll recommend a few good options, thankfully I picked NVDIA on this one."
2025-07-30,"At the moment, I had accumulated around $10k cash and diversified it amongst different good tech stocks. All in the green today, just not as much as NVIDIA"
2025-07-31,It accumulates multiple times a year. Anytime the market is down we invest.
2025-07-31,"but the math is still off.   
I put aside 10k a month for investment .

if you are a working adult and investing only 10k at any 1 time and few times a year, then what are you doing with the rest of your money?"
2025-07-31,Buying houses? Paying medical bills? Going on a vacation?
2025-08-04,10k a month? Thats it? Where’s the rest of your money going? A working adult should be able to invest much more than that

2025-07-28,"Buy it whenever. EXPECT it to go down. Wait 6 months and then go from there. I used to be the same and found if you just allow for the price to be less than what you bought it for, you can relax. It will go up, but in the course of a few months.
Expecting the drop is almost a relief now because it's not a panic. It's forecasted. Hope you can get there"
2025-07-28,"Wait til after earnings..  I feel a drop coming on as they will beat, but not blowout, this q."

Long term dca and buy in"
2025-07-28,When I bought it in 2024 it stayed flat for a year then went up. It might crash right after you buy or go up.
2025-07-29,"dont fomo. buying a stock is an important moment. buffet has a lot of cash waiting for opportunities.

see last year nvidia. in aug all hell broke loose and it zigzagged like crazy 1 full year after

it has beta of 2, meaning when spy drops x nvidia will drop 2x

PE 55 is on the high end for nvidia

saying it will never drop lower is to say trump will be a good guy from now on. no drama will be in the world, no inflation in usa, no conflicts, no AI bad news, no vera rubin ‘delays’ like blackwell had etc. nvidia always dropped hard before earnings last year 

check fair price of analysts etc

my fair price is 50 PE so a 10% drop from here or a spectacular earning report"
2025-07-29,Are you saying that the best time to buy is yesterday and the second best time to buy is today?
2025-07-29,That's why you buy indexes ...
2025-07-29,I thought that too but I just started buying and now I’m sitting well
2025-07-29,"I learned a long time ago trying to time the market is Folly let alone trying to find the entry point.  Every spare dollar I have had I’ve been throwing it into Nvidia for the past year and will continue to do so because even at its all-time high today, I know there’s plenty of room for growth in the future.  
 as a matter of fact, some analyst who I put very little stock into by the way, have predicted $1000 per share for Nvidia by 2030.  
 that being said Regardless of what they say I do believe that that is a very real possibility of rising to the 1k level by then and perhaps even sooner"
2025-07-29,I bought at \~700  before the split shit just buy in now.
2025-07-29,Dude you gotta look at the big picture. This is not gonna be at this level 1 year from now. I'm glad I spent all my funds buying NVDA and has kept buying on any weak days
2025-07-29,I bought at $165 around less than weeks ago. Wish I bought more!
2025-07-29,The dip will happen if it misses earnings
2025-07-29,"Here’s my litmus test for determining if right now is the right time to buy Nvidia—

2025-07-28,Yet when it drops below 120 all of you guys are panicking and selling 🙃
2025-07-29,Everytime I try to short NVDA cuz I say 'its time for a pullback' it just keeps going higher. I've lost my ass. But I know as soon as I buy it will shit the bed.
2025-07-28,It will pull back at some point. May be not below 100 but I’m buying more if it drops below 120
2025-07-29,If you think it’s a company worth holding longterm DCA into it a little every week then lump sum what you can if it drops 20% from its 52 week high.
2025-07-29,"exactly!. Buying a house soon, do you see it continuing to go up til earning s and even further?"
2025-07-29,This is like buying Apple after the iphone 3g.  There is no competition and we are living in a new world.  Back up the truck.  It's only going higher.
2025-07-30,I think any day around Liberation day was a good entry point.
2025-07-29,Bought at 400 and sold at 500 for a profit. NVDA kept rising as I was waiting on the sidelines to find another entry point. Finally said screw it and bought 10k worth. Up 55% since then you just need to buy it.

2025-07-29,"explain? 
if you think its a company worth holding long term, then should you not lump sum what you can NOW?"

2025-07-29,"If you’re nervous about dumping in a lot of money while a stock is at an all time high, like OP, it’s a way to ease into it. It’s just easier psychologically and better than waiting for the perfect price to come along."
2025-07-29,">Its one stock in the market, its not quite accurate to say it is ""timing the market"", as the saying would imply.

That's **literally** what that phrase means. What the hell are you going on about? ""Timing the market"" can refer to timing a specific stock, index ETF, industry or other ETF, mutual fund, bonds, anything. ""Timing the market"" is a generic phrase that refers to attempting to get in or out at the ""best time"" of any investment vehicle.

Hell, you could even ""time the market"" to purchase a house with the best mortgage interest rates.

Holy hell, your pedantry is borderline insane."
2025-07-29,"but if you are of the OPINION that the current price is too high, then should you not either short it, or wait for it to drop to a target price in your mind before buying?

It doesnt make sense to be half bake about your decision.You either buy or you don't, and DCA only because you only have that much spare cash to invest at the moment."
2025-07-30,DCAing only gives better returns over lump sum 30% of the time but it prevents emotional decision-making 100% of the time. I don’t panic sell but I get FOMO bad. I’m far more comfortable with DCAing than waiting for the perfect price to come along.

2025-07-26,Could drop after earnings because I have read a couple articles that the ramp back into China isn’t going to be easy. The main thing I see as problematic is TSMC shifted the silicon production that was set to manufacture H20’s to other products and Jensen had also said basically that they don’t have supply on hand to ship to China. That’s why they are working on a “ dumbed” down Blackwell for China. With everyone thinking Nvidia will get a big boost it just might not happen.

2025-07-27,"Aren’t you saying companies are investing in NVDA because of trumps tariffs? 

How do you suppose one should compute that statement you made?"
2025-07-28,Companies are yes. Not due to tariffs in their own though. Example- Trump limiting export controls to China. Obviously bullish for NVDA 🤣
2025-07-30,"Nope, I am a reasonable human who would never vote for a person with dementia to run the country.   Good thing that’s getting all straightened out now, one day at a time"
2025-07-25,"Absolutely it can: namely their monolithic quantum dot laser photonics on silicon is a potential game changer. Why? Made on scalable 12 inch wafers in a method that is up to 10x cheaper than the “old” way. 

Incidentally these the same for InGaAs LiDAR, namely compound semi conductors on large silicon wafers with the benefit of scalability and cheaper cost (10x). This tech can make previously very expensive but superior InGaAs LiDAR to consumer products. Think LiDAR on your phone being able to see 30 yards instead of a few feet and in the dark or indirect sunlight…

Who is paying attention?
1. NASA (x2)
2. The Navy (at least 4  awards,  two in the last 30 days)
3. Department of energy (x2)
4. Office of the Secretary of Defense 
5. DARPA
6. Nobel prize laureate seeder  (invented blue LED)

This is the real deal IMHO."
2025-07-24,"The data centers run by hyperscalers (providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) make up a significant portion of Nvidia's revenue. They sell the fastest processors in the world that are required to train and run AI models like ChatGPT.

Other companies like Dell and SuperMicro package Nvidia chips into servers. Companies like Vertiv provide cooling systems for these servers that run extremely hot. Companies like Oklo and Centrus provide efficient power for these hungry servers.

An entire ecosystem is required to bring the power of Nvidia chips to the world, and this ecosystem is growing at breakneck pace as companies are in major competition to build out infrastructure to host AI applications.

This is very similar to how Cisco powered the Internet in the 1990s. They were the only game in town for advanced routers needed for the bourgeoning infrastructure needed to run the Internet. They became the largest company in the world and experienced phenomenal growth until the dot-com bust in 2000."
2025-07-25,Data center run on processors.  NVDA sells processors.  Data centers need more processors as they grow and expand.
2025-07-24,ELI5: The data centers essentially allow companies to run a bunch of complicated software without having to invest in the hardware or space to run it. Instead they “rent” it from Nvidia and run it over the internet.
2025-07-25,"1. Hardware
2. Software

Look up Cuda and invest in Nvidia stock.  Never too late."
2025-07-24,"NVDA is not an AI company. They are not a crypto company. Not a block chain, or machine vision, or RADAR, or self driving car, or anything else company. They aren't even a PC video card company.

NVDA make high count, highly interconnected, embedded processors.

When there is the Next Big Thing, it will be on NVDA chips.

In at $1.50"
2025-07-24,"Companies move their AI into the cloud to avoid buying their own infrastructure. 

Some build their own and then buy truckloads of Blackwell chips."
2025-07-24,"Since I’m not any kind of expert in this field I will try to give you my take on how NVDA makes money on data centers. For an example let’s use Microsoft. In the beginning they wrote operating systems. Now once you bought a computer with Windows that would end Microsoft’s revenue. So, Microsoft built their Office system that could only run on Windows. They made a browser to compete with Netscape. Microsoft Money for banking. NVDA has a proprietary software CUDA that maximizes their chipsets operability. While Copilot says CUDA is free when used with Nvidia’s enterprise solutions they pay an annual fee. Just like a business that runs a thousand computers pays a fee for every computer running Windows. 

If this isn’t right I’m sure someone will correct me."
2025-07-24,"Amazon, Microsoft, Google and others pay NVidia big monies to buy chips. At the same time NVidia uses those monies aggresively to compete in the cloud computing market. And there's nothing the companies can do about that because AMD sucks."
2025-07-25,"NVIDIA’s “Data Center” revenue isn’t primarily from NVIDIA running its own data centers or renting out compute. It’s mostly from selling GPUs and networking systems to Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, Oracle, etc., so *they* can run *their* data centers.

DGX Cloud and the software/platform stack are growing and now material, but hardware sales still drive the majority of NVIDIA’s “Data Center” revenue."
2025-07-24,Don't forget to tell us the number of shares.
2025-07-24,"it's not particularly ai it's just that GPUs are much more efficient in handling data streams, which accounts for alot of what the big companies are doing. CPUs are inherently bad because of their architecture in handling alot of data fast in parallel."
2025-07-24,"Nvidia sells GPUs, they (usually) don’t rent them out.

What you mention in your original post about designing chips is not even true for consumer grade cards. Nvidia manufacture chips which they sell to Asus/MSI/etc so they can build graphic cards.

For DCs they just sell GPU to big players like Meta and Microsoft."
2025-07-24,Their long term goal is full vertical integration of the cloud computing business. Very soon it will be completely wrong to think of them as a chip selling company.
2025-07-24,"What a headline.. And... Short King Cover you say??

2025-07-24,That’s a pretty number in a short time frame. Those alerts are worth more than gold for sure.

2025-07-24,"Thought this was heading towards a tip about investing in Uber but it turned into incel shit.

This is an Nvidia stock sub, what compelled you to post this here"
2025-07-24,"I'll bite

I'm more confused why this took so long from Uber standpoint.

From your driver database, anyone who is marked ""F"" for Sex when you confirm the background check is the only available driver option in x radius for any rider who marks ""F only"" and it will prioritize F for this rider user unless only an M is available via round robin or whoever accepts (I've never been a driver so I'm not familiar with this logic in the backend)

This doesn't seem groundbreaking at all from a technical perspective, but also OP is also right what if I identify as a F as a driver? I'm sure some of those drivers exist.

Hopefully NVDA hardware processes all of this and stock price goes up ⬆️"

2025-07-24,"You'd be right.  Nvidia has been reporting ""Data Center"" as a segment since 2017 when it was around $1B."
2025-07-24,"BB currently has a market cap of 2.42B which is only 0.058% of NVDA (4.17T); and yet it is providing the foundational software (QNX) for NVDA DriveOS along with practically all of the major automotive OEMs that are actually serious of autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, robotics, medical robotics, and a host of other embedded systems the world is (or will be) using."

	•	Increases systemic risk
	•	Compromises diversification
	•	Distorts passive investing outcomes
	•	Creates vulnerability to single-stock shock
	•	May catalyze broader volatility if sentiment   shifts."
2025-07-23,Better yet buy the stock and be done with this nonsense.
2025-07-23,What do you mean by that? How are they crushing premiums? When and can we buy back cheaper? Are premiums going up or down? IV is 39% which is normal to low for this stock. What am I missing?
2025-07-24,lol OP has no idea what they are talking about. They were probably stupid and bought options when IV or Vix was high and now wondering why they are losing money on OTM calls with short expirations
2025-07-24,"Breaking news, man lands on the moon

This happens at every single earnings, all us apes buy the same options around expected moves of earnings, and market makers pin to the strikes of the greatest exposure of their books.

2025-07-24,If you buy options you have a gambling problem too. It just makes you feel better to point the finger at me.
2025-07-23,Good. More competition will lead to more advancements in Ai and more use among the common people. Let's go! 
2025-07-24,To me and please understand i truly know less that nothing about options.  But it seems like gambling outside of Vegas.  I just buy or sell stocks and MFs I believe in.
2025-07-25,Sue you are in the NVIDA stock subreddit not WSB
2025-07-23,"these don’t happen every day.

Take $OPEN for example. There was chatter on WSB and other spots. And guess what? $OPEN has options — so once the squeeze talk started, people piled in. Options make it way easier for that hype to catch fire.

 **nobody knew $KSS would rip 100%.**

  
but there was a chatter of squeeze.  Just like no one really saw $OPEN going on a wild run.

That’s the game. You look for the setup: chatter + high short interest + options = potential. But the big moves? Still unpredictable. When they hit though... they hit *hard.*

the beauty is buying it small, so you can just hold.   if you go big, you will get scared, so you will cut it when it's down -30%.  

well, that's how he trades. 

I'm completely apposite.   I hit 6-7 base hits a day to make a living.   i'm terrified of losses and i go in big.  so i eat 10-20% gains and be very happy.

Day trading is all about options and small caps. 

There's places where you have people doing real researches."
2025-07-27,This is highly incorrect. Options is much more riskier then trading shares!
2025-07-27,"most people hear ""options"" and think max risk, casino stuff. But it’s actually way cleaner if you keep it simple.

We just do 2 contracts max, 0DTE. That’s it. If each is $100, worst case I lose $200. I know my risk before I click buy. You buy shares and that thing tanks $3? You're down $300 and it keeps bleeding. At least with options I’m not married to the thing.

Plus, I’m not holding anything overnight unless I'm swinging. No earnings gap. No Fed surprise. I’m flat by close and I sleep fine.

And if the setup isn’t there? I don’t trade. 

It ain’t some get-rich thing.  My buddy trades 2-4 contracts 10 times a day and makes $1500. Insane daily return. 

Just controlled shots. The key is going small so you can hold longer. 

You curious about the strat or nah?"
2025-07-28,It tanks $3 I average down. I average about $2-4k daily trading shares. So I believe shares is a better play and that's off 1-2 trades with about $250-450k pending the ticker. I just don't like options. I've seen people blow their whole portfolio and I've been more successful trading shares and more profitable. Options is riskier by definition ion unless you're selling CSP. Also trading that many contracts 10 times a day is a lot of trading if we're being honest.

Between now and the 30th Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon reports earnings.  If CAPX stays the same or increases Nvidia will be just fine.

2025-07-22,I can't handle it nah it's not that more or less trying to get a understanding of what people's opinions on whats it doing I'm looking at it from a long term investment perspective
2025-07-23,True but try and understand It like I understand what Warren buffet says like everyone panics when the stock drops in price but I buy more ahah but more or less just trying to gain perspective on what it's doing I'm not a day trader but when would be nice to get some wisdom
2025-07-22,HOLD HOLD HOLD
2025-07-23,I heard about that contract awhile ago I did a whole bunch of research ages ago there going to building data centres over the next few years and NVIDIA will apart of that toso the stock can only go up I'm more or less just gain perspective and understand cause I'm new to this trying to maximise growth and grats man sounds like good investment
2025-07-22,Usually there’s a significance to a rapid drop like this probably see 4-5% drop today. It’s most likely profit taking but the question is valid to be asked
2025-07-25,It’s one of the earliest and powerhouses in the ai chip industry with ai still being a long way. It’s gonna go up regardless

2025-07-23,Nah but he's making a huge impact in AI and the future of the American economy and he's a master mind ceo so I figure worth backing him hyper competitive person so what ever field he's in he will want to be number one
2025-07-22,"Depends if you know how to do it, are you okay losing the shares and then your appreciated capital?

That's all a covered call is really, just selling your unrealized capital for realized value, the risk for realizing the value early is possibly getting your shares called away."
2025-07-22,"Do not sell covered calls on NVDA. I sold $150C when the stock was at $130 because they were .96 delta and they became ITM. The stock hit $175 at one point and I couldn't sell. My CC is still under water.

Don't. Fucking. Do. It. Not on this ticker."
2025-07-23,"It’s actually good that currently NVDA is about 3% down now, interrupting the straight upward.
l follow this company for over 10 years and l can see NVDA  next step 10-15% up."
2025-07-22,"Thank you , Do you think running covered calls on VZ is also good for a beginner?"
2025-07-23,"I understand this take but want to offer an alternative view. 

I own 20k plus shares at a CB of around $9. I recently sold Dec 195 c for 7.60. I collected 151k after commissions and plan on doing this every 4 or 5 months with OTM calls. I can collect healthy premiums and if the stock gets assigned I’m ok because I have such a low basis. 

So it can make sense just depends on your facts. Since you’re new you’d have to pick a price you’d be willing to sell at and sell that strike price."
2025-07-28,I don’t understand did u hold underlying? Wouldn’t the shares automatically sell at the strike?
2025-07-22,I sell CC (and CSP) on both. Premiums are not good on VZ and option liquidity is not great
2025-07-28,Yes. But I’m forced to sell at $150 in Oct while the stock is well above $170 now. It’ll likely be over $200 by then
2025-07-22,"I’m about 25% ($400k), I’m 62 and retired lol."
2025-07-22,About 5%. I got up to about 12% but sold back down to 5 since I try not to hold more than 5% of any one company stock.
2025-07-22,Right at 25% at present prices.
2025-07-22,"CSPs, haven’t been assigned yet tho, but it would be around 75% of my portfolio if I were assigned (my income account only tho)"
2025-07-22,Hopefully you don't have a large portfolio cause its stupid to put $100k or more in one stock.
2025-07-25,Only 13.35% because when I bought my shares I didn’t have more money to spend.
2025-07-22,"Since you're looking for more under 141, when do you expect this dip? Think it's coming near the beginning of august, like the usual pre earnings dips followed by rallies?"
2025-07-22,"Ha, higher than me! Sorta what I expected to hear from people on the NvidiaStock subReddit. I can see your logic - nothing else seems to be doing as well and have such a wide moat. I bought into BTC more as a gamble - it did nothing for a while, now looking to increase over the next 1 or 2 quarters. I'll probably sell at that point.

I bought Boeing 2 days after the Air India crash, sold yesterday (a month later) - 17% up. Morbid I know, but money is money :)

I can see Siks's point - eggs & 1 basket etc. Microsoft are reliable, PLTR, well, I'm still not quite sure what they do! Everyone tells me their stock is massively overpriced, I'm taking the long term view with them.

I do look at other options - Motley Fool are praising Shopify (SHOP) as one of their top 10. Not really convinced. Maybe nice for a bit of diversity."
2025-07-22,"I have more than 100k in NVDA. As the portfolio grows (in $ terms), you go for more diversity (as Siks does) rather than more in a small number of stocks? I can see the benefits of diversity to an extent, I had more, i shrank it to the ones I now have as I can focus more on them.

What do others think?"
2025-07-22,"You must realize that many investors have much more than $100k to invest. Much, much more.  100k may mean a lot to you- but not to someone else."
2025-07-22,I have no idea. I just look at the quote from my broker. Sometimes it's low enough to buy and sometimes it's high enough to sell
2025-07-22,"I am awaiting after August 1 to see what will happen with Tariffs then it will be clear what to do next , i am currently on HOLD too high to buy Nvidia , Meta and other Nasdaq stocks   , just my opinion"
2025-07-22,"I certainly don’t love it 100% I wish my other stocks had done better but I got in back in 2017 so the growth is unmatched.

What can I replace it with ? Or add to it? Well I’m buying OPEN to see how it does"
2025-07-23,"If $100k is not much to you, its fine."
2025-07-23,"And a LOT don't have that much..... 90% of ""investors"" on reddit are 20 to 30 somethings who can barely pay their rent.....

Their portfolios are lucky to be over $10k....."
2025-07-23,"If you believe Apple will eventually get the AI right, then you hold / accumulate. If not, then probably should sell."
2025-07-24,"Yeah, so?  These investors, like me, who have much more money and more than 100k invested in NVDA, are ‘stupid’?"
2025-07-23,"OK Boomer. You may not know what a meme stock is and that's OK. Never have I ever imagined BRK.B or PFE being called meme stock 

If you knew what an index fund is, you would also recognize that I have a few of them. Which index do you particular recommend? I'm beating all the indices I know of, so I would appreciate if you can recommend one that ""doesn't lose money"". Take your meds grampa and chill with your hundreds of billions you inherited lol"
2025-07-24,You don't even have $50k lol
2025-07-23,"That portfolio you have is junk.  Its a ""trust me bro"" portfolio and thank god you don't have much money in it!  I wouldn't trust anything over $5k in that portfolio.  You really should just buy 90% QQQM at your age and mess with only 10%."
2025-07-23,"PFE VZ NOK and most of those stocks are all crap that aren't gonna return jack.  Ever heard of NVDA GOOGL AAPL MSFT CRWD etc??  That's where your money is gonna return.  But like I said, if I were you, I myself would just buy qqqm and call it a day.  There's no way anyone sane would trust $100k in that portfolio, cause more than likely, in a few years it would drop to $50k ....  That's why people rely on VOO and things.

Sure, if you have $1000, you want to gamble with, throw it in some meme selling for $4 a share and have at it, but I haven't even heard of 50% of those stocks.... and that means they're junk....  If you hear about stocks on CNBC, those are stocks worth owning."
2025-07-23,"I've got $260 million,  Didn't get that with meme stocks.  The old fashioned way, working 2 jobs and saving.  Plus my granny left me $150 mil. but that's from sale of real estate she owned in high end part of town."

2025-07-22,Buy and hold pal
2025-07-22,"Buy if you plan on holding for 5+ years, Sell if you made a profit and need the money, Hold if you still believe in the company."
2025-07-23,"Just holding. I bought a few hundred at $100. Now have 2500 shares. Big tech earnings this month will give us a read on CAPX. I actually think that Nvidia, even with blowout numbers, it will be what they say in the phone call about sales projections to China that will be a difference in how pricing. Also with the high probability of the Fed cutting rates in September they will be at or under the 4% rate which just might get movement out of MM funds and back in the market."
2025-07-22,Hold
2025-07-22,Now is the time to hold and buy more if it goes down.
2025-07-22,We're not where near the top.  I've already taken my money out and profits.  So hold what I have and add shares during the dips.  After 200 I'll take more profits.
2025-07-23,HOLD and BUY MORE
2025-07-24,Alphabet just posted earnings and said that they have gained revenue across all platforms from AI and they said that they will increase CAPEX spending from $75 to 85 billion. This has Nvidia green after hours and I think we will see more of the same next Wednesday when Meta and Microsoft earnings are reported.
2025-07-24,Buy because I sold
2025-07-29,I have a large position and I keep buying more. Not selling for at least 10 years. period
2025-07-22,I think there will be more opportunities to buy after August
2025-07-22,It’s red buddy.
2025-07-22,Red as fuck

2025-07-22,Investing. Com
2025-07-23,I believe in nvda and pltr long term more than ever.
2025-07-21,"Do the stock lending if you’re holding you can always take it back. Not many people shorting so you won’t get much but it’s something. 

Also sell very far out covered calls. Like 10 or less delta. Even a few hundred extra can give you some extra in the meantime why you wait"
2025-07-21,Keep holding and add in the dips.
2025-07-21,Yeah. Not bad probably.
2025-07-27,"I’m trying to understand why people wouldn’t stay in. If it’s true that AI is the future and it will pretty much transform everything and that AI spending will continue to increase and that Nvidia controls 80% of the data center GPU market (not 100% sure that’s correct but it’s what I read), how could it not continue to grow and increase revenue? I think people don’t get it. Maybe they think AI is overhyped and they view Nvidia in relation to a traditional business.  Or maybe they think companies like AMD will cut into their market share. I think the sky is the limit especially in the next few years since China is behind and needs Nvidia chips.  I also think AI is under hyped and most people don’t understand (or want to believe) what’s coming and how fast it will come. It’s actually self learning which is super scary and reminds of the 1980s movie War Games.  Yes new and better models are being developed, but at its core it’s a self learning technology that gets smarter every day. That’s a wild thing when compared to traditional software.  I think long term they could have problems because the tech is changing so quickly, but I don’t see it in the next 3-5 years."
2025-07-22,Withdrawal what you invested let the rest ride
2025-07-22,I'd be placing covered calls like mad....
2025-07-23,Why aren't you taking advantage of that income opportunity tho
2025-07-21,Good job!
2025-07-21,Take your profits now big bear run coming. If your -400 off that little fraction of a dive you will lose huge in next bear run. I'd take the profits and run
2025-07-21,Are you diversified in other things too? I’m afraid to put everything in AI. I also am still holding a bit in my ETF
2025-07-26,don’t be a scared little boy
2025-07-21,‘Think about it’ is not a convincing argument. Labour is usually the largest expense when it comes to running a business. Corps are actively trying to reduce labor count with the help of AI
2025-08-14,"If the tech sphere is where you're comfortable, then trade where you are comfortable. Investing in AI stocks is not putting all your eggs in one basket. All of AI is not going to disappear and crash overnight. The stocks may sometimes seem to move in tandem but they're not going to crash all at once. If that happens you can go ahead and expect a crash across multiple sectors."
2025-07-22,Do u reckon buy
2025-07-27,I’m good thanks
2025-07-22,I’m not buying it.
2025-07-21,i swear whenever i see this guy post i‘m thinking about taking a break from reddit
2025-07-21,We should all downvote every post and comment from this loser. I can’t stand seeing his repetitive lying posts anymore. “People mocked me for buying at $3 30 years ago” “the ceo is the friend of a friends dad” “people said this stock was doomed and they made fun of me when I bought at $90 a couple months back”
2025-07-21,Reddit is more entertaining than real good information.
2025-07-21,Yup. See you at $180 this week!
2025-07-21,I'm a loser with $260 million?....
2025-07-21,Ok lil bro😂 in the long term im all for 200+ this week ur tripping dawg
2025-07-21,"You don’t have that dude. Take a hike. If you really had that, reddit would be the last place you’d post 3 times a day"
2025-07-21,"Green futes! $15! $230 million portfolio!


This guy is probably 10% of my entire reddit feed. Ive heard more of his made up life than actual family members"
2025-07-21,Why? Cause millions mean you can't come on reddit anymore?....
2025-07-21,Humor us then. Show us your “$260 million”. I bet you don’t even have 100k
2025-07-21,I bet you don't even have $20k!   Ahahhahhahhaaaa. You'll get there eventually.... just keep saving $50 a week
2025-07-21,I just got 50k invested last week. Fortunately I don’t have to make up lies like you.
2025-07-21,Thats great. Keep going and you'll get to $300k by the time you retire...
2025-07-20,Its not going to keep breaking ATHs. There is going to be profit taking. 
2025-07-20,The moment I see a Reddit user come up with a theory on Sunday why the stock is headed down I’m almost super psyched because that means without fail it’s going to 180
2025-07-20,Checking the daily lose is just diabolical.  Never a smart way to look at investments.  A smart man told me this so I pass it on to you.
2025-07-20,"If you think dropping 0.34% from all time high is ""tanking the whole stock"" then you shouldnt be investing or discussing it"
2025-07-20,"There is no grand conspiracy every red day. This stock is up like 80% from its lows like 2.5-3 months ago. Things dont shoot up forever, especially at the market cap of 4 trillion comparative to the rest of the market"
2025-07-20,"I find it hilarious everyone knows “why” NVDA is down. It’s the China supply issue, of course.

Or, perhaps a stock that has just had a huge run without any significant pullback was long overdue for some selling.

Starting to see signs of extreme greed in this market. Beginning of the end of this rally, perhaps, before a normal, expected and healthy correction kicks in."
2025-07-20,"It’s manufactured concern. People also want to just be right about a stock prediction… if they say it’s going down long enough, eventually they’ll be right. 

NVDA stock is going to go up and down, but over the long term it’s going to go up. Maybe not at the rate it has over the past several years, but is anyone really going to complain about 10%, 15%, 20% annually?"
2025-07-20,"What I'm going to say seems stupid, but I think we need a pullback if we don't want the RSI to reach new heights, and that would even be the signs of a healthy market after the increase that Nvidia offered everyone. 
These concerns do not come from the bad news but rather from the certainty of not having any other good news in the short term. The dips will be filled by latecomers and institutions once this decline occurs, and in any case the increase will resume because NVIDIA is constantly diversifying in the tech market and has a clear and predictable roadmap over at least another 10-15 years (Quantum, Robotics, Smart City, etc.)."
2025-07-20,Exactly. Reddit is full of radical plebeians and newbies making it the ideal contrarian indicator.
2025-07-21,"I won’t worry about dropping a point or two from an all-time high.  It’s not going to scare long-term investors to press the panic button.  If the stock price drops substantially before earnings, it is opportunity to buy."
2025-07-21,Computers were selling hard above 174.00
2025-07-19,"As long as the US needs China's rare earth minerals, the H20 chips will be delivered. The policy will not change."
2025-07-22,I have plenty of bets that were wrong but i bought 2000 shares in 2018 for 12K.  $6 cost basis.  I will probably hold another 10 years. 🚀
2025-07-22,No worries **$169.51** ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2025-07-22,"Too Bad Quantum is going to blow Parrallel computing out of the water like a Nuke is to a shotgun shell

Don’t get me wrong

First AMD perfected the CPU
Then Nvidia the GPU

There will always be room for. The CPU and GPU

The question is which Quantum company does DaddyJensen have to buy because he didn’t see this coming???

I literally have been around and building computers and cars since the 80s

Quantum and AI will change/possibly destroy our world a lot SOONER then DJ thinks

Look DJ and DJT are now friends!

The writing is on the computer screen folks"
2025-07-23,Funny how it was 155 then 90 then 174. Making a tsunami with the European arms makers such as Rheinmetall and Leonardo. Frankly they made NVDA look bad. Sold NVDA at 150 rebought at 110 and am reconsidering keeping thousands of shares in a stagnating 4 trillion dollar company I love.
2025-07-19,And then it closed at $172.35
2025-07-20,"No one should be investing in this imo, only day and swing trades, it’s far too volatile to have your entire account wrapped up in this like quite a few folks do."
2025-07-22,Donate me like 5-6 shares for the fuck of it 🥹 haha just kidding but that’s extremely amazing I’m sure in the next 10 years it’ll continue to boost & grow especially since AI is heavily influenced & used in today’s world
2025-07-19,Investing in Nvidia ain’t for the faint of heart. 😆
2025-07-23,"Wrote once a grad paper forecasting this, 2020, the race, loaded up on NVIDIA. everything you say is technically correct but the result will be lesser valuation. For example, cars will never need quantum computing (and maybe cloud will do it for some aspects). never never, maybe a Star Trek Shuttle if ever. Two, there are a variety of national level assessments arriving at the same conclusions- besides crytpo benefits, there is a severe diminishing returns for quantum. The more quantum one buys, the more useless they are. So what 1,000,000 GPUs need to do today, x1 quantum unit would replace, at a fraction of the cost. In terms of data, most national needs (with data storage projections towards 2050s), can be achieved with less. which is the point of computing, More with less. Or Less, in this case, means a low low low valuation for all these companies. They will be cannibalized like no tomorrow. Compare this with coal plants vs nuclear. You need a high ratio of coal to x1 nuclear energy plant, and there is a reason for that. Now, nuclear is far more expensive to set up, etc. But in this case, quantum will be the opposite. QBITS and RGTI are hogwash (and still own some and made money speculating on the mania, not the tech). But, basically, the odds of NVIDIA becoming a 10 trillion $ company, 5, 7, in an era of competition, in an era where quantum computing can shatter NVIDIA's very reason d'etre (and what keeps Jensen up at night), tells us NVIDIA's valuation, like all tech, has a very finite lifecycle.  Apple still stays up due to sales and service. Once NVIDIA is done leading because quantum kills any of these processor, so it is done as a top leader. Ask IBM. Ask Matrox. etc."
2025-07-24,"I’m not an investor, I swing trade and collect premium on ODTE SPX.  So listen to others about fundamentals and stocks. But anyone can look at this chart and see it’s bullish as hell from most all timeframes.  Nothing at all wrong with this stock"
2025-07-24,"Oh I’m not denying that it’s the best stock to buy if you buy and hold dca. But for someone like me, I want to be in cash at the eod if possible. I sell premium on 0DTE SPX daily so I usually have a few positions on over night.

I don’t buy shares of nvda though, I buy zerbras at a fraction of the cost. I have zebras on for 180 days out for about 1/8 the cost of shares. Not sure if you know what a zebra is. You sell one 50 delta and buy two 70 delta calls. That synthetically gives you 100 delta position (runs like 100 shares of stock)."
2025-07-24,I wouldn’t say volatile like bitcoin is though. I don’t mind volatility in a solid company with a history of innovation because I’m an investor long term.
2025-07-24,You got my head spinning 😂😂😂 no I don’t know what zebra is. I’m a buy and long term hold investor. But I am open your o learning new strategies.
2025-07-24,"I have long-term stocks for the last 10 years in spy , qqq, nvda (since 2020), MSFt Amazon etc! Those I do not plan to touch for the next 25 years. 5% of the portfolio is options which I have lost a lot of money playing the nvda last year. Now I will buy a few options here and there which are mostly leaps, but I suck at short term options unless I’m doing a quick strangle. I have no idea how people on this forum convert 50,000 into 5 million. so I will buy a few leaps  expiring in two years and it automatically sells once it is in 20% profit with a limit sell order. I’m amazed that people can convert 10,000 into 50,000 overnight."
2025-07-24,I suck so bad at options. Gave up on them before losing much
2025-07-24,"thank God. I felt like I was the only one who sucked that short-term options.  Once in a while, I might do two or three options like recently did Tesla and it was all time low and sold before the earnings. But that’s the maximum of my risk tolerance!"
2025-07-18,It was Astronomer CEO Andy Byron
2025-07-19,Lol all these bets and all this gambling is fun to watch.  I don't really understand it.  I just buy the stock and hold it until it's time to sell.  Simple and profitable more often than not.  Works for me.

If you look into the semi-conductor sector and artificial intelligence as a whole, you'll understand that Nvidia's moat is huge. Also, take a look at the company's balance sheets. 

I understand what you're saying though, some people do get carried away, but come on man, it's an amazing business. ROICs are uneblievable, so are margins, their GPUs are far ahead of any others competitors'... It's the real deal."

I only ask because I’ve been in NVDA since July 2021 when it split the time before the 2024 split: I paid 194.99 that day.  I really should’ve bought it in a Roth, but bought in an IRA instead.  I have only about 4% of our portfolio in NVDIA, I really wish I would’ve bought more when it dipped, but unfortunately I wasn’t wearing my balls of steel that day.  If I had been smart, I would’ve been.

I bought in 2021 because the chip shortage made me realize that NVDA was a good long term buy due to the fact it is used in just about everything. What is your reasoning?"
2025-07-18,"Lets say your 401k account is in fidelity, to keep everything together you can open a brokerage account there and do your own investment there manually yourself. Also pls wait for a dip since we are at an all time high."
2025-07-18,Open a schwab account online.  Download the think or swim app and your up and running.  Watch a few YouTube videos about the think or swim app to learn how to buy and sell.  I like Nvidia
2025-07-18,"It sounds like you're saying ""I've picked NVIDIA already, and now I'd like to learn how to invest.""   
  
Honestly, I'd start by learning about investing and then *after* that I'd pick a stock. Obviously I'm an NVDIA fan, that's why I'm here, but other peoples' stock advice is generally worth it's weight, so pick your stock based on what you learn, not by whoever has captured the zeitgeist at the moment.

There are great resources available all over the place anymore, so it shouldn't be too hard or time-consuming to start to get a more basic grip on things and then - hey - dive on in!"
2025-07-18,OP did you see that ServiceNow is under investigation for wanting to purchase Moveworks? DOJ antitrust probe?
2025-07-18,"Well, first off, you need to create a brokerage account. You can probably do that at whatever financial service house runs your 401k. Then transfer the money to that.

However, just plunking down money and hoping for the best (even on NVDA, which is currently about as much of a sure thing as exists in the market of the moment) is the WORST way to learn.

So first, do a bit of learning. You'll need to know:

**Basics of investing.** Different ways you can invest, how to do them, risks/benefits of each. Stocks, bonds, ETF, mutual funds, options, crypto, precious metals. Buy/hold, swing trading, microinvesting... Even if you do nothing more than basic retail investing (strongly suggested here), you need to know all the ways people are trying to make money, and how it all fits together to make a price go up or down.

**Market Fundamentals.** What determines whether a company is well run and likely to make money? Also, what determines if the price it's trading at aligns with the actual value of the company? Is the stock price inflated, undercooked, or just about right?

**Market Sectors.** AI is just one small piece of the hundreds of thousands of companies you can invest in. You need to be aware of the many opportunities available, some well known, some known only to the few.

**Price movement patterns.** What are the tea leaves the market displays that give you an idea of what to expect in the future? In the end, investing is more about psychology than anything else, and humans behave in predictable ways. Which means that prices MOVE in predictable ways. Not guaranteed, but still predictable.

**Macro issues.** What other factors can affect both the performance of a company and the mood of the market? This is both financial-based things like jobs report and GDP reports, but also things like lunatics in the White House, wars, China, tariffs, lunatics running health care, and so on. You should know what the TLA VIX stands for and its significance.

At that point, you're in a position to pick a number of stocks...preferably a wide range rather than a narrow group that will probably move the same way...follow them for a while, get a feel for how the price moves both in the short term and long term...THEN put down your money.   

For a reasonably intelligent guy this should actually be FUN. And potentially profitable. There are more resources available online than you can shake a stick at...though needless to say everyone online has their own particular angle to work. So a healthy dose of both curiosity and skepticism should do you just fine."
2025-07-18,"I have seen some posts/comments from more experienced investors on different subs regarding stocks being at all time high currently and market is possibly going to  experience a correction/dip around August-September, also them mentioning that August-September are statistically the worst months for US stock performances. So save a chunk for that possible dip. I’m fairly new to this too, got some money invested and have some sitting ready to go.  Of course, it’s not set in stone and we might moon instead, market has been illogical lately. Ah, yes, open a brokerage account at Schwab or Fidelity. Look into RKLB."
2025-07-18,"Fidelity is also an easy way to get started in about 10 minutes. You can open an IRA,Roth or Taxable Brokerage account. It will prompt you to link your bank account so you can transfer funds as desired. Your funds will automatically default to SPAXX. which is where uninvested cash sits and earns around 4%. You can then buy stocks with your funds. When you sell a stock the proceeds immediately return to SPAXX and are available to trade again the following day. It’s really very easy and you can call the representative if you get hung up. Make sure you understand capital gains tax."
2025-07-18,Buy high sell low
2025-07-18,"Really easy to open an account online at Schwab. Fidelity, too, but I’ve been with Schwab 40 years. Schwab makes buying and selling stocks in seconds very easy.

5 years ago I knew nothing. Less than nothing. It was all a big black hole and I just closed my eyes and hoped everything would turn out ok. There were some intermediate steps but I learned the most by reading reddit, specifically r/stocks, every day, and looking up what those people were talking about in the Research tab on Schwab and studying that page. There are some smart people in r/stocks, and they’ve made me some real money. I made some mistakes but overall have done really well. 

Hang on to some cash but you can’t go wrong by parking your money in QQQ (or QQQM) and SPYD (or SPLG). I favor QQQ myself, and maybe some TSM. Aside from that I’m doing well with AMD, PSIX, VRT, RKLB, VST. The other thing is, don’t sell when there’s any downturn or crash. Just ignore it and buy good stocks on sale. The market always, but always comes back, and goes higher."
2025-07-18,"Buy 1 share of everything you want today after setting up a brokerage account. Watch it now that you own it and you can see how it feels to have skin in the game. The highs, the lows, the 😁 and the 😭. 
 Do not buy penny stocks! Only buy stocks that are currently winners. Don’t speculate at this point in the game because you will 100% loose your money 
Now go get you some shares."
2025-07-19,"I went all in last year at its high then traded manically until I finally got a very good position. It was stressful as hell and almost lost my ass. My recommendation would be start very small and buy slowly over the next 2 months. Probably there will be a big correction soon. If not you make some money. Once you have a full position start trimming when you are in profit, reinvesting on dips. Worked for me but could be terrible advice."
2025-07-19,"Open an Etrade brokerage account. Sofi, Palantir,Amd are good investments now."
2025-07-18,"I think it's about bit of that. I remember about seven or eight years ago being told about BTC from a guy at work I thought was a kook. Shame on me but I also want to have a separate stream of investment that I can directly control myself. In my 401k I don't get to pick the specific stocks but only percentages of what categories the management company provide (small capital, large cap, international, discovery, etc...).

It's not just Nvidia (though they are my most popular choice) but other things like ServiceNow, The Metals Company, and other AI related areas. I'm in IT and kind of wrote all this AI stuff off as a novelty like I did with BTC, but I'm coming around to believe its here for the long haul."
2025-07-18,"This is what my dad who passed away in 2018 told us kids, invest in what you know. My dad worked for caterpillar he bought and traded caterpillar (cat) stock on a regular basis after he retired. He knew when it was going up and when it was going down.  He bought Illinois tool works (ITW), navistar, ford, c, mo to name a few.  Navistar was his biggest winner and he bought it primarily on margin because he believed in it.  I made the mistake of unloading his caterpillar and Illinois tool works between 2020 and 2021 because I figured they’d come down again.  Because I don’t know that market, I could not recognize the steady slow rise that would occur.  
Like I said, I invested in Nvidia because every darn stinking thing uses a chip these days.  I own AMD too.  Made the mistake of not buying TSM at the same time."
2025-07-20,"The different tax implication is why I wish it had been purchased in my Roth - tax free - account not the “traditional” IRA account.  I dropped the word traditional while typing since most individuals intuit the meaning of tax deferred without the qualifier “traditional” when they read IRA, but I am sure you were just clarifying for the greater good."
2025-07-18,"No, they’re too large for that, but it might cause the dip that makes it worth buying in"
2025-07-18,"I will say that if you need the money right away, don’t buy stocks when they’re at all-time highs because there’s always a dip and you can’t panic sell because you see a dip that might last 6 months."
2025-07-18,Good advice
2025-07-18,I don't necessarily need the money (we are not what I would consider rich but obviouslyit does not hurt to have more money). No debt with about $200k saved up. Not a lot but we aren't hurting *knock on wood*
2025-07-18,"If you’re not a panic seller type and you’re willing to hold on long-term, then Nvidia is definitely a good buy.  Just don’t use your emergency fund.  I haven’t used the think or swim app, but I’ve heard good things. My brother uses it.  I should probably download it to test it so I can compare it to the other companies that I know. Most apps have paper trading, trading that does not use your actual funds, that you can use to test their app if you have an account with them."
2025-07-18, The security personnel at the psychiatric hospital in your city should be fired...

2025-07-18,"So you want a Rivian so bad, huh!"
2025-07-18,lol this guy. Thank you for making the stock go up more for me. You should have bought at $80 like I did
2025-07-19,"Wow.. a lot of faith to buy at the peak. Perhaps buy high, sell higher. Good luck, bro!"
2025-07-20,"If this were to happen, you might as well just be in the Q's or SPY.  At its current weighting and considering the Nvda multiplier- Ives says $8 of spend generated for every $1 spent in gpus.  That would imply maybe about a dozen $3T+ companies in those indexes. And also implies the megascalers are generating enough revenue to increase capital spend.  The tail risk would be handled by rebalances. 🤷‍♂️"
2025-07-18,Bro its gonna bear run soon your gonna get jacked ..
2025-07-17,You really think after earnings Nvda will dumb to $120?

2025-07-18,"I'm in since $15 a share buckaroo! There's no such thing as ""late to the game"" when we all know that in 10 years this thing will be at very least $500 a share or more."
2025-07-18,Lol I bought at $15 years ago also
2025-07-19,"The peak?  What the heck is that?  Look at a chart and tell me where all the ""peaks"" have been in history. NVDA will be $500 in a few years, all you have to do is hold."
2025-07-19,"I sold a large portion on Friday. Doesn’t matter where stock goes by got alerts for 165,155,145. I’ll scale back at 155 and already have my orders entered lol"
2025-07-18,"I think NVDA is a great company and will do very well over the long run. Short term we are in an environment of extreme greed. Investors are piling in through FOMO and wanting to make a quick buck. Inflation is rising, conditions for rate cuts are being worsened, and stocks are overvalued right now. I believe we will see another repeat of last year, where around this time stocks took a big correction to the down side. Tariffs kick in starting August, and I believe we will see inflation start rising higher than what was expected. Once the panic starts, it will be a rush to get out first. I personally wouldn’t buy NVDA above 155, as I believe they aren’t worth that much at this moment. Time will tell if I was right or not."

2025-07-22,"just seems suprising is all to go there. don't me wrong, it goes there, i 10x which is great. i just am not sure if i see passed 10-12T market cap at some point..let alone alomst 30T"
2025-07-19,I can dig the platitudes but you got any quantitative analysis to back up your thesis? This sub needs more accountability to have any tangible value.
2025-07-18,"I'm in 75% NVDA the rest are split between AVGO, ARM and I just got out of CRWV today - I made 40% on it but it's too meme stock-ish to me.   

I know CRWV is gonna fly at some point but I don't like stonks that drop for no reason $10 a day when every other stock was up.   Reeks of AMC and BBBY and GameStop lol"

2025-07-17,"Hmmm, I was buying it up at $98 and $105, so tasty."

2025-07-18,"How big do you think the NVidia market cap can go? Because for the share price to double from here you're looking at 8T. That's 6% of the global market capitalization! To put it another way, NVidia's market cap is bigger than the whole of the S&P energy sector which sits at 2.9T..."
2025-07-18,"Boring. No value add here. NVDA is a solid stock for 3 years min. 

Nothing else to say except if you can’t ride the market then stick to the poker machines"
2025-07-18,Still creeping up buying a bit more here & there despite the ATH. Hoping for a blow out earnings call that increases momentum.

2025-07-19,Nvda is real. A phenomena that happens once in a life time. Still a way to go. I accumulated thousands of shares starting 10 years ago and I’m not selling because I believe it still has a lot to go.

2025-07-20,"That’s true.  Nvidia did extremely well last quarter even writing off the banned H20 chips.  Now that exports control of H20 has been lifted,  earnings for the second half of 2025 should be robust."

2025-07-21,"""Compute is the new energy"" is such an inaccurate statement. Compute by definition needs energy. Or do you think that the data centers that power the cloud & AI are somehow generating energy?

You don't need to do much research, just check how much energy we're consuming today than say 5 years ago and how much we're projected to use with AI, Cloud infra, etc...

And all that while we've been underinvesting in energy for decades. At some point either you won't be able to use your AI chatbot and possibly the lights will go off or we'll have to produce a lot more energy. I'm going to bet on the latter."

2025-07-17,I doubt that the H20 sales this quarter will be significant after all there’s just two weeks left in there quarter. But the earnings call will be the difference maker. That’s where they will layout what they think the sales to China will now add to the third quarter. Plus I think I read that they wrote off $4.5b in H20 chips so basically they have no cost with those chips.
2025-07-17,No! NVDA is a big customer of TSMC. The manufacture the silicon in their fabs for nVidia. This earnings is seen as a signal or trend.

2025-07-19,Not Guly priced in…stock plummeted on last earnings margin miss over 1/2 trillion. H20 will catapult margins to +75 or greater which is hugely creative to Cash flow. It will be very risky to short with this in mind.

2025-07-17,Curious if those analysts with the sell ratings even have a pulse?
2025-07-17,"To answer your question about ""5T - do we get there""

Answer that yourself.   Do you think NVDA has enough steam in its current and future product offerings to continue breaking sales targets?   Or are they out of gas and it's downhill from here... 

Are there any viable competitive threats coming from anyone in the immediate future?   I don't see it.

And wait for the robotics revenue streams to start showing up within a year or so 

Ceiling isn't gonna be 5T... Nope."
2025-07-17,"I said this at $1T and I’ll say it again, I say $8T-$10T by 2028."
2025-07-17,"I sold mine at $140 i highly regret it i thought for sure with Trumps tariffs and the way he is handling things , i did not expect to rise for record high now , what are your guy’s opinion on when to buy back for long term , right now i think it is too high to buyback , would like to hear some opinions 🤗"
2025-07-17,Targets change all the time.  If and when it hits $200 the this will change again.  It really does not tell you a lot.  While analysts may have better intel it does not mean that is where it is going.  In the case of NVDA there is a higher level of confidence to not look bad.
2025-07-18,"Depend on the next 2 earnings, we will know better, but usually that means 12 months prediction. ... And I have no problem with that, as I'm more focus on 2030+✍️ $500 🎯"
2025-07-18,I wouldn’t put too much weight on targets.

2025-07-17,250 is too crazy.at some point there will be profit taking by most people. Happens w every stock. Lets see how the numbers come out for faang earnings but I won’t be surprise if that forces the stock down
2025-07-17,Usually they target one year out.
2025-07-17,Usually 12 months out from the date of the target setting.
2025-07-17,"I don't think the analysts specify the time period. This is definitely not 5 years though, probably shorter. Let me see if I can dig up the data."
2025-07-17,"haha those are quite close to the current price, so almost no one is expecting a bigger dip anytime soon."
2025-07-17,"TSM reported earnings and it’s up another 1%. After being up 20% in the last month. Another 20% higher is $5 trillion valuation at just over $200, which could happen as soon as next month. Just a crazy run tbh"
2025-07-17,It's usually a 12-month target in an analyst's write-up unless they say it's different.
2025-07-17,You think it’s too late to get in at this price point? I know… just wishful thinking..
2025-07-18,"If your project is long term investment, then dont hesitate NVIDIA have a clear roadmap that investor and corpo trust for easily 5 or 10 years (AI, Quantic, Intelligent City, etc).

But dont invest just bc of fomo, every week someone come like you and hesitate to place on, bc they hope a dip like the last krach, but that wont happen again, unless a specific event that could impact severely the tech sector is notified. 

I'll not talk too much, as my english is bad, and I dont want to choose for you, I'm not an expert just an investor like you, but if you have a clear strategy, and you trust in the structure of NVIDIA then you know what to do."
2025-07-17,Senior executives are normally on a defined plan to sell shares.  It’s not like Jensen woke up today to some hint of bad news and decided to sell shares.  This is a horrible way to evaluate executive sentiment…

2025-07-17,"Because he wants some liquid cash? And it's still a tiny fraction of what he owns overall. I'll never understand the panic over insiders selling unless it's dumping *everything* they own. They're human, they like money and want to take advantage of it."
2025-07-17,No body can answer this question. Technology is hot and semiconductor companies will continue to grow. Where do you see institutions pouring money into? Politicians? These are signals.  Nvda is a HOLD
2025-07-17,I think we go up from here for a while. The China good news is huge. NVDA wrote off 5 billion for the sales of its product and didn’t include it in forecasts. They now get to sell that already written off product. The numbers and forecast for the next earnings are gonna be juiced. 
2025-07-17,If it breaks $175 it’s going to $200
2025-07-17,When is this sell off to $150 or $160 going to happen?
2025-07-17,Right after earnings.
2025-07-17,"I don't think there's going to be a dip...at least, not like the old ones.

I DO think that at a certain point, the Trump Bubble is going to burst, and the reality of what he's doing to the economy is finally going to penetrate the market...might not be this year, but it's coming...but until then, I think NVDA is going to be a pretty boring growth stock. I think we MIGHT see a bit at the quarterly...but then again, I wouldn't be that surprised if the reaction is more along the lines of ""yeah, we figured this out already.""

If you're waiting to get in, I'd say stop waiting.

'bout damned TIME, by the way."
2025-07-17,I think the chance of it dropping below $40 is pretty low. Anything is possible
2025-07-17,"Just hold. It is not dipping anytime soon, if at all."
2025-07-19,Depends on the market. NVDIA isn’t the sun although to some they think it is. Yes it can cast a shadow but can’t avoid the gravity of the overall market going down and S&P 500 just attained a new all time high and that usually indicates profit taking. Plus too many issues present and we’ve yet to fully see the effects of tariffs and production loss due to undocumented either taken or afraid to show up to work. Data is slow to show but not invisible for ever
2025-07-17,"Depends what kind of Major dip we are talking about here, a recession dip or a correction dip. Correction dip i say $155, but a recession dip i say $70-80"
2025-07-17,"Tomorrow, Friday at the latest. Putting in my sell order tonight."
2025-07-17,"thats were my covered call strike is, I'm trying to get out of it and hopefully waiting for theta decay to kick in to get out of them without a loss"
2025-07-20,So … there have been 6 or 7 ATH over the past week or two with the S&P 500.  There was a sell-off on Friday. It that does not mean a thing!
2025-07-17,I'm on the exact same boat as you. All my covered calls are at 175 Strike and I really don't want to have to roll.
2025-07-17,"I got $200 strike calls, sold them at $32.25 when NVDA was $157 these calls expire in over 2 years, only around $3 has decayed so far since I bought them"
2025-07-20,On Feb 18th there was and all time high but did not return until June 27th since then there have been several more ATH.  Historically the have been hundreds of them.  The markets do not stop at an ATH.  Thursday ATH will not be the top.  Physiologically it does play a role for some.
2025-07-20,"Been at this for forty years. Markets tend to take profits after achieving all time highs. Especially when overvalued as is the case today. Especially with all the concerns and mostly due to uncertainty. 

Was your psychology comment some kind of back handed slap as if you are in the know and others still guessing 😂 🙄"
2025-07-20,No not at all!  Sorry if that how you saw that - no intention.   I see this all the time on Reddit where people ask if they should sell due to a stocks ATH or even based on an index ATH.  Caution should be considered rightly so!
2025-07-20,"Fair enough but my comments purely on the plausibility of retrace coming which tend to happen around peaks. Especially with uncertainty driving sentiment. Granted selling just for the sake of selling likely premature but best be ready to exit. 

Obviously depends on type of trader. I’m not an investor therefore capital gains don’t drive my strategy yet flow will cause me to sell and profit from typical market drops. 

That’s the problem with social media in that these types of questions asked as if there’s one boiler plate answer satisfying all. 

Were I just starting or not yet fully confident in my ability to gauge market movement then DCA and trust likely less stressful and more profitable assuming that invested expected to grow. Impossible to know any of that from a rather loaded yet very broad question. 

Why best I can see happening is that I’ve seen before and that’s still no guarantee yet I’ve learned through many mistakes often safer to assume the worse than just hope tomorrow better than yesterday. Could also be I’m just old 😂"
2025-07-17,That under $1 entry is a pretty solid flex
2025-07-18,Are you selling them soon?
2025-07-16,"Yes, you ""pull gains"" by selling shares. You also have gains in the form of dividends. NVDA will pay you $0.01 per quarter and that will be paid in cash to you"
2025-07-16,Also. You should be able to select which shares you want to sell. You can with fidelity. I imagine it’s the same with other brokerage. Why not download the positions info (no personal data like your acct #). Upload to gpt and prompt it the question you just asked. You can ask it to analyze it for you.
2025-07-16,"The only way to ""pull your gains"" is to sell some of your shares. So naturally the number of shares you own will go down, yes."
2025-07-16,"Yes - looks like you have about 130 shares. You can sell 1, 5, 10, 50 - however many shares you want. If it’s not in an IRA you’ll pay tax on the gains, FYI"
2025-07-17,Yes lol. Your gains happened because the value of the shares went up.
2025-07-17,"Do you know how stocks work?  Yes, each share is worth a specific amount.  Over the years there may have been stock splits so you could have gained shares.  If you want to take your gains you will have to sell a certain number of shares.  You can keep your initial investment amount of money in the account."
2025-07-18,"Of course, you would need to sell some"
2025-07-19,Should you really be investing?
2025-07-20,"Maybe you don’t understand what gain means 
You bought 128.5141506 stocks at 121.96 per share (average buy price) 

The stock price has since rose and now each share price is 170.88 

For each share you are seeing a gain of 48.92 (multiply by total number of shares which is your total gain ). The number of share that you bought is same but the price has gone up there for you see “gain” (unrealized gain) 

Now in order to get the benefit of this gain you have to sell share ( this is called realized gain) .. so each share you sell at current price (170.88) the total share you own will reduce and you will get realized profit"
2025-07-21,Depends what price you sell. Value is calculated by last price but you probably won't get that. That's why you always sell limit order
2025-07-19,If people like op are investing I think it's a good indicator to pull out and wait for the crash 
2025-07-16,buy high sell low
2025-07-16,"Long term hold, buy. Short term hold, I’d wait out."
2025-07-16,If you believe it will go to $200 I’d buy or I’d buy now and if it drops you buy more at a discount. I’m not a trader i invest when I buy I buy and hold buy and hold repeat for 5/10/15 years it’s always worked. On companies that are the big boys and never disappoint year after year. I started buying NVDA in 2010 ish and still buying today. Hope that helps you make your decision. All your decisions depend on your psychology. This is not advice just my opinion my style strategy.
2025-07-16,"The fact that a company is at all-time highs does not mean this will ALWAYS be the all-time high.

Start by investing an amount where, if the price goes down 10%, you won't lose your mind. Get used to the risk of investing, get used to tracking price, and go from there.

And yes, a lot depends on how you want to invest. If you're buy/hold, this is the way to go. If you're going to be a short-termer, like a swing trader, get used to tracking prices and market moves before you start plopping money down."
2025-07-16,Nvidia to $400/share within the next 5 years.
2025-07-16,Not if you hold for the next 10 years
2025-07-16,"Waiting for it to be the first company in history to break 4Trillion and close above 4Trillion. That’s all it took for you to notice? 🫠

The unfortunate thing is, the majority of the growth is been and gone. The issue with large numbers is that they get far more difficult to double. 

Perhaps look for other opportunities or go for the S&P500 since you say you don’t know much. You won’t have the stomach for news-led selloff and panic = losing money."
2025-07-17,"If we all knew, we’d be rich. Or not rich, because if everyone knew, someone would be left as a bag holder."
2025-07-17,"Just buy. If it makes a dip buy more, if not be grateful. It can go up to 300"
2025-07-16,"It’s not as good as buying at $90 but if you believe in AI, NVDA is the clear leader. There will be outliers that make more than NVDA but there will be many total failures. For me NVDA is the best balance of aggressive investment while still buying the clear industry leader. It might not 1000% this year but I expect head to head with S&P it’ll come out nicely ahead. You can always get your feet wet with a small part of your account and average down on big dips which are prob still likely."
2025-07-16,"If you have the balls to hold for 5-10 years, then sure buy now. But if you’re going to panic when it dips back below $160, then don’t buy."
2025-07-17,Better invest in amd
2025-07-17,Trump has dementia so even though he might say NVDA can sell to China. He can come out and say ban ai chip sales to China
2025-07-16,"People asked the same question at $150 - including me. To echo previous comments, this is a long term hold. If the expectation is a quick jump and sell, this is not your stock. You can attempt to time a short term dip, however, you may be locking yourself out if it never comes. If you have the cash to allocate, id say buy now and hold it. Last thing you want is to be kicking yourself in the leg when the stock sits at $200 for not buying at the bargain price of $170. 

Disclosure: I don’t know anything about anything so take the above with a grain of salt."
2025-07-16,Buy and hold. People thouht buying at $130 was a bad idea and look at it now.
2025-07-17,If you plan on holding long term then yes if you plan on selling quickly maybe not the best idea
2025-07-17,"Many analysts have set targets for $200 of late, so you will have a profit. Then just hold and continue to watch. It’s not going down anytime soon, so don’t sit on the sideline if you want in on an amazing company with one of the greatest CEOs. Dudes got deals locked up with so many companies and so many countries. It’s going to be solid for a long time."
2025-07-17,"Asking for financial advice on Reddit is a bad idea. Everyone has different needs, risk tolerances, etc."
2025-07-16,Don't buy now if you have to ask on reddit
2025-07-16,Yes..... buy something else like asts..
2025-07-16,Wait! It’s $169.87 right now
2025-07-16,Will go to $200 soon…. Easy 20% gain $$$$
2025-07-16,"Depends on your goal. Are you investing or trading? If you’re trying to trade the stock in the near future, I would hold off because there will definitely be a correction in the coming month(s). If you are trying to invest into this company, which I push for more then I don’t see that being too big of an issue. Either way always do your best to DCA"
2025-07-16,Buy google and amazon before earnings
2025-07-16,"Its always a good and bad time.

We all thought 150 was too high because it suddenly increased. We thought the same at 160. And now at 170.

Its a good time because we know the same as when it was at 150/160 so it could very well keep going, but its a bad time because its pretty much an ATH.

Theres no way to know for sure. You either gamble or hold long term (which is kind of a gamble as well, just the lesser)"
2025-07-16,I bought at $650 and I am doing fine
2025-07-17,"Some people will tell you no. I will tell you yes, it is a bad idea. Wait for a dip or pullback."
2025-07-17,Don’t buy heavy. If you want to buy buy light
2025-07-17,Please buy so it can dip to the 130s so I can buy more
2025-07-17,Are you planning - buying “high” and selling “low”?
2025-07-17,Lol buy high work Wendys
2025-07-17,"Was buying at $50 bad? $100?, $120, $130, $140, or $160?"
2025-07-17,Not if it goes to $180+/share!
2025-07-17,There will definitely be better entry points than $170
2025-07-17,"It all depends on how much you can put in, and how much you can wait. If you have less than 20000$ to invest and can’t wait 5 years to take it back, I’d say it’s not worth it now."
2025-07-17,it will go back to $100 next time trump shifts on tariffs or there is news of competition
2025-07-17,"Depends on what your portfolio overall looks like, how long you plan to hold NVDA for, and your risk tolerance"
2025-07-17,Who knows but people were asking the same question at $100.
2025-07-17,Yes. Everyone should of bought under $100
2025-07-17,I been doing calls fuck buy shares cost to much in my opinion
2025-07-17,You can buy nvda partners with a low cap and got a lot of potential like my favorite  $SMCi . Amd don’t have cuda for me it’s pointless . You can bet on asics :AVGo is very expensive Marvell gonna be a better buy from my point of view but Microsoft delayed very bad news . Even asics can’t catch nvda I lost some thousand on this .Wish you the best profit of your life mate
2025-07-17,"No one knows for sure, but I’m betting on the long game."
2025-07-17,"Buy low, sell high!"
2025-07-17,"I stopped adding at 140, waiting for a dip and if not there’s other AI shit to buy."
2025-07-17,Buy anytime and pretend you don’t own any shares
2025-07-17,"I can’t remember the guys name but this morning on Fox Business he said that Nvidia should have a $5/ share profit this quarter and they are running a multiple of 40. That translates into a $200 share price. He thinks they will go to $6 by the end of the year which boosts the price to $240. I’m not adding to my position but I have 2500 shares and that $200 price is a cool $500k. Remember it split at $1200+ last year. 

Another thought. At some point the Fed will start cutting the interest rates. With Money Market HVSA paying just above 4% it won’t take many cuts before the $5-7 trillion dollars in MM funds start moving back into the market."
2025-07-17,It’s a buy for me. The story still holds
2025-07-17,You want to know if buying a $200 stock for $170 is a bad idea? Let me think about that.
2025-07-17,"its up **(+1,516.23%)**Past 5 years i think its safe to buy anytime. hold it dont sell"
2025-07-17,Buy when everyone is selling (like April 4th to the 7th). Sell when people come out of the woodwork wanting to buy for the first time (like today).
2025-07-17,"I think there is still substantial room for increase here.  There is momentum, shareholder positivity and the tendencies for this company to be innovative and cutting edge."
2025-07-17,Yes patience is key to investing
2025-07-17,Will it  be a bad idea when nvda is $300 in a couple years?
2025-07-17,In 5 years I doubt it would be seen as a bad idea. 
2025-07-17,They’ll drop at the end of August (historical for the market). Just wait until then…of course I could be wrong because there’s no magic ball but shares go down generally on the 1st September…
2025-07-17,"My personal view? Yes. It’s a bad idea given that run. 
“Experts” think that it could reach $200 I would just set some long terms but remember it can backfire so you better just keep your long term and not regret one or the other. Consider what are you ok with losing and what is your tolerance limit. I will wait for a dip because that was a big hike."
2025-07-17,It’s not a bad idea if you plan on holding long term
2025-07-19,I sold and will buy back after the next correction
2025-07-20,My personal opinion about nvidia is that they don’t have much time left. I mean their products are top notch but I guess I’ll sell all my position when they hit 5-6T.
2025-07-20,"If you buy at $170 and all indicators pointing $200 by eoy, will that help answer your question?"
2025-07-16,"Wait longer and find out 😂
Why didn’t you buy in April/May?"
2025-07-16,"Why didn't you buy at 160? Or 145, 120, or 100?"
2025-07-16,This is a great time to buy! Dollar cost average and give yourself peace of mind.
2025-07-16,"Yes, you should have bought when it was $80 on tariff surprise day like I did"
2025-07-17,"Buy high buy low, never sell."
2025-07-16,"I’m just afraid with them now able to sell in China and being one of the big dogs in AI development, $170 might become the lower end in the near future."
2025-07-16,That’s the average Reddit user logic
2025-07-17,"Sell puts, sell covered calls later lol"
2025-07-17,Buy high sell higher
2025-07-18,"Sell high, Buy higher"
2025-07-17,You mean buy low sell high
2025-07-16,I bought at $650 and now it’s $170. Truly an experience
2025-07-17,"I would say either way he should wait, it will definitely go down a bit, it's ATH now... There's no reason to rush in if you're long term holding anyways... Especially with the tariffs still on the table Aug 1...."
2025-07-16,Got any current calls or next big companies currently priced at let’s say around or under $15?
2025-07-17,My feeling is that $170 to $200 is going to take a while.
2025-07-16,"This selling to China didn't make them the Big dog, they already were. This China deal is just More of a desert, a bonus. If you plan to hold for a long time, then buy."
2025-07-17,"Obviously $170 will be considered a steal someday. It's going to be a volatile road though so what will you do if you buy and then tomorrow Trump says some dumb shit and the price drops to $120?

If you're going to panic then don't do it. If you can buy and forget about it for 10 years then sure go for it."
2025-07-16,"Fear isn’t a good emotion for investors.  If you are afraid an investment will fail, you shouldn’t be buying stocks.  I’ve had a dozen or so go to zero, having fallen from great success and being top profit makers.

Generally individual stocks should be bought with a 10 year plus time horizon in mind.  They are a great company that you can see as at least double their current success in 10 years. One should also be buying 15-30 of them if you are young.  The winners cover the mediocre and losers.

So NVDA may be one of your winners, losers or average companies. 

I’m stuck with them as an overweight part of my portfolio because I bought in 2013 and 2018 and have held since then.  This is how successful investing works.

Based on your post you should be buying NVDA by buying an index fund like VTI.  Remember that when you buy an index fund you are buying quite a bit of NVDA at its market cap so you will benefit from their success."
2025-07-17,"fomo is not the way to play the game. nor is fud.

long term sure 170 is ok as it will eventually go to 200. if you got in earlier in the year like me at 115.15, or the people during April fool's week at 85/90, you would have been in good shape, and you might be looking to dca about now. 

but look at it from this perspective. years ago I was looking at Google at 85 during their IPO. I was like that is too high, and waited. I didn't buy in until much later and the market cap was now at least 500B vs 10-20B....so massive missed out my 10k would be 100k or 1MM by now. 

nvidia sits at over 4T in market cap now with being at 1T only a couple of years ago. it has had 170-200% rises but that growth is hard to maintain. there is often 10-20% swings in growth stocks during the year... if you have a few you can look at the charts to see this is true. 

targets have it at 8-12T by end of the decade. so, it is up to you if you want to go in now, or wait out for 150-160 again... or maybe 140-145.

also remember what goes up, tends to come down. in my MBA class we discussed Sears. it was pre-2011 business discussions in the course even with me taking the MBA recently. after 2011 they made some mistakes and now it is worth maybe 30 cents. 

So what I am saying is if you feel it is a good price, go for it, if not look elsewhere or just go into a etf or mutual fund with heavy nvidia exposure. or dca... put your foot in and slowly get in... Noone says you need to fully buy all shares at once. 

your call."
2025-07-17,You’re probably right. But buying now at 170 is just uninformed buying/chasing
2025-07-17,Hate to reference btc holders but at one point even 50k was considered a bad buy.
2025-07-21,Pfizer (PFE) 7/25 $23 puts. 8/1 $22 puts
2025-07-17,That would be closer to 10 trillion.  People are funny.  They think nvidia will absorb every dollar on the planet.  I do not think this is a good buy at $170.
2025-07-16,"Again, you know how difficult that will become after 3/4 years. I think we have more room to run but say 25% on 5Trillion is 1.25Tillion in a year… then overvaluation becomes a factor. So you’re thinking it’s a safe bet for a beginner. 

Look at the volatility from Jan 6th through April to now 🙃
A beginner wouldn’t have the ability to not panic sell"
2025-07-17,"So true, people ask me what percentage return am I looking for and I say at least 100% knowing it’s outrageous to expect that but then when you have Nvidia, Palantir and Robinhood you become accustomed to such returns! I tried the slow growth small caps and they can pay 8% if you get lucky but they stay in a tight range for years most of them. Homie don’t play dat game!! Invest like you have 5 years to go! Go for the Gusto!!"
2025-07-19,"Made other comments on this, very volatile and lots of chop but I’m in it. Got in at $83 thinking I’d missed the majority of the move (lol). Short term downgrade from HSBC cast doubt right as they announced the acquisition (that many think is too soon after an IPO). 

I’m sure that after bitcoin pops off, CRWV will too as a consequence. Then the never ending demand for data centres in the coming years… 🤌🏼"
2025-07-17,"NBIS is generally considered the better stock in that field, but both have lots of legs to run"
2025-07-17,$170 to $200 is $4.2T to almost $5T
2025-07-16,If this is true I strongly recommend that you avoid individual stocks as your investment plan.  Read bogleheads investment wiki.  I wouldn’t recommend more than 5% of your investable income go to single stocks.
2025-07-16,Then definitely don't buy at $170. You'd panic sell at $160
2025-07-19,"Yup, long term this company moves much higher."
2025-07-21,"if you have lump sum now, DCA-ing makes no sense.  it's either you believe in it at the current price (in which case you buy), or you think it's overpriced currently (in which case you wait).

spreading it across several transactions just means you are unsure and incurring unnecessary additional transaction costs (no matter how small) in the process."
2025-07-17,What % decrease or price range would you consider a fall in price to be a pullback/dip?
2025-07-17,It is?  What will you say when it hits $200 in a few more months?
2025-07-16,I’m fine now old job wasn’t giving any hours I have about $7000 extra to play with atm
2025-07-17,Strawberry Shortcake
2025-07-17,"From people / institutions that trade. This shit is overbought like a mofo… it’s been straight up since April lows, daily RSI over 78 and weekly pushing 70. Gaps to fill just under 120. Can look up Fibonacci retracements with Elliott Waves, but anyone buying right now is just asking to hold some bags. Now I doubt you’ll be holding forever, but sentiment has moved into extreme greed.. buyer beware"
2025-07-18,"Buy more today then. I personally don’t wait until *after* the 100% rip to add. I added in the $90s, not when we’re technically overbought. Might be $200 in a few months, but I’ll wait for a pullback and support before adding more"
2025-07-17,"Fell your pain, I held through it and it has been a rough year of chop. I definitely think we have some tailwinds now and good chance of continued growth before another profit take"
2025-07-16,"So I missed PLTR, I think it does have a way to go but unsure how I feel about the company in order to invest. Absolutely a strong AI stock. 

I put some money into Coreweave when it was dancing around $83 (thinking I had missed the run up at that time). That has way more growth at current evaluations but volatile and not for the faint of heart. Recent acquisition sent it tumbling but as soon as bitcoin booms, that will in turn pump this stock even higher."
2025-07-17,"I think it is wrong thinking to ‘play’ with that $7k.  With wise choices I beat the S&P 500 by a decent margin for almost all of the last 40 years of investing so as I hit 60 I am well into 8 figures. I retired in my early 50s.

Just some advice from an old pro."
2025-07-18,I’d say around $153 would be pretty good
2025-07-18,"Dude if you have a point to prove then out with it. Are you buying more today? Did you buy yesterday? If you’re such hot shit then buy more and quit dick riding me about it. I’m not some emotional buyer that feels fomo when we’re pumping new ATHs, but maybe you are. Doesn’t matter to me one way or the other, but if you’re betting there’s no pullback and never will be then good luck is all I can say"
2025-07-18,Was tinkering with Fib retracements on the daily chart and saw 153 as one of the price levels. Was that where you got the figure from?
2025-07-17,"I've been buying NVDA since $15 a share.  If you didn't, you missed the run friend."
2025-07-16,"I want to be optimistic and say that's just a ""time in the market"" thing. Today, we are looking at those who invested in Nvidia 10 years ago. These same people might have been doing the same with another stock at the time, and the new generation will be doing the same, looking in 10 years at the ones among us who invested in the next Nvidia."
2025-07-16,"Bingo!  I knew a guy who did UPS deliveries to my company for years and I trusted him.  He was very smart.  One year he told me to invest in Bluetooth technology and I didn't have a clue what it was so I didn't make that leap.  He made thousands and he was right.  Years pass and he came to me and said to buy Nvidia.  It was around $3 per share at the time.  I decided to use my bonus from work and bought $5k worth.  Now, I wish I could find him and thank him for that tip because I  be making bank now!!!"
2025-07-16,"How quaint!  For a few people, it's more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLScfl_-VBY&t=39s).  However, [this employee](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/16q7ncw/my_unconventional_path_to_30m_nw_what_do_i_do_next/) would have $100M+ now, if he's still holding them all.  It would put Walter White to shame."
2025-07-16,Palantir and nvda are still the best stocks to invest in . The journey just began and smart people will still make a fortune. I’m an investor.
2025-07-16,I wish there were easier ways to invest back in the day. Now there’s Robinhood and you can trade fractional shares. I remember trying to learn to invest and you were stuck with only the larger brokerages that required a minimum of 5-10k to open an account.
2025-07-17,Been in NVDA for about 3 years and just as excited today. Even bought more shares today at $170. Hoping for a blow out earnings call next month.
2025-07-19,No school will teach that.. the big tycoon stock investors won’t allow it.
2025-07-17,Excellent point. And if they actually taught investing in school.
2025-07-18,"2018 for me, and it was always pretty steady and I believed in it. So I kept investing in that, while also investing elsewhere. But NVDA has always been consistently good so I have always kept putting more in"
2025-07-16,What do you think should we invest on now ? We should ask him😮‍💨
2025-07-17,If your in it for the long run then hell yeah
2025-07-17,"in school, they didn't teach me about the credit score system or even how insurance works like home or car insurance. I had to learn this shit the hard way. some schools didn't even teach kids to write checks."
2025-07-16,"Idk, I'm waiting for the usual FUD that makes the price dip a month before earnings and then rise to ATH before earnings. It's been doing that for a year now. Coincidentally we have the new tariff deadline about a month before next earnings..."
2025-07-20,"Pure guesses. If I know the future, I wouldn’t have time reading Reddit. Lmao"
2025-07-15,If you hold long term then it’s still early.  If you are looking for a trade then may want to wait for the next dip.
2025-07-16,"Just gonna drop this:

People asked the same question 2 weeks ago when it was ~150$. People said it was too late.

Do some research & Make your own conclusion with that info."
2025-07-15,"No one knows where this will go but over the longer term it will certainly increase in my humble opinion. You might be best to wait for a pull back to reduce your average price, but then a pull back might not come along for a while so you would be out of the market."
2025-07-16,"It is far from a low risk entry with the stock 13% above its prior high and overbought.

The same could be said for the entire market.

That said, we will likely keep going higher until the rug gets pulled. When it does, overheated stocks will take the elevator down.

Many will say ""long term you'll be fine"" and they're probably right, but if you buy here will you withstand a pullback to $153 that is highly likely within the next 6 months?"
2025-07-16,Anything under $200 is still a bargain.
2025-07-16,"The reason nvda has value is that it is a first mover in a potential massive market. On the other hand, that market may be overhyped. If you believe it’s a massive expansion of the market, buy. If you believe it is overhyped, don’t buy."
2025-07-16,Several analysts have raised their targets to $225-$250.  AI is just getting started and NVDA dominates chip market.  Buy and hold now and you’ll be great.
2025-07-16,"Anytime you buy something at an ATH on a run you have a risk of a pull back short term. NVDA is an awesome company though and will almost certainly go up long term. 

I find it is usually better to buy stocks when they have a dip not when they’re high. I got into NVDA when the deepseek news came out. As long as you’re confident in the business over the long term things will rebound."
2025-07-16,"Too late to make generational wealth? Yeah probably, but Nvidia will continue to go up because of the AI revolution. So at the end it's still a great long term investment"
2025-07-16,"I bought at 70 and honestly at that time thought it was too late. I was so sad when it went down after that. And look at it now, you never know and it might just be early. I’m still dollar cost averaging into nvidia even at this price"
2025-07-16,NVDA long term play my man it will go to 500
2025-07-16,"Get a hobby, forget about the stock and in ten years buy a boat."
2025-07-16,"It may not be too early.  Look at companies like apple, tesla, microsoft, etc historically.  They have been at highs and reached hgiher highs.  I am a Nvidia bull"
2025-07-16,"Depends on your goal, if you want to hold it for the next 5 years then you're good. But if it's short term then you might want to wait for a pullback."
2025-07-16,"I have about a hundred shares. If I am being totally honest, if you don't have enough money to buy at least a hundred shares (preferably bundles of a hundred) to sell covered calls, while holding for 5-10 years, there are other investments... I don't think it's too late by any means, but there are definitely other choices."
2025-07-20,"it is a matter of dca, dollar cost average. if you believe it will continue to go up then buying more means you get some at a different price.

dca works with things you feel have more meat on the bone. I do this mostly with long term holds I see long term growth with them.

for example low fee s&p etf/mutual funds. it averages 7-10% a year in the long term and a 1.25% dividend. there it makes sense to dca that.

it is how you think of things with projections.

at some point you might also say... that is enough and hold like Warren Buffett did with ko and aapl. you then sell some off at times to have realized gains and reposition into other ventures."
2025-07-16,yes bro keep buying at all time highs 😂
2025-07-16,"Don’t buy individual stocks. If you are new to investing, you are setting yourself up to have a lot of regrets when you arbitrarily buy into expensive stocks you heard about on TV. Just invest in low-cost, market-cap weighted ETFs."
2025-07-16,"4 trillion market cap company selling picks in a gold rush. A gold rush in which NOBODY has figured out how to make a profit. Even ChatGPT’s most expensive subscription operates at a loss.

I understand the optimism around ai and nvidia but be skeptical. Ask yourself how much can this company realistically grow if the ai boom yields results. How much will this company drop if sentiment turns negative. Is that risk/reward worth it

Nobody is going to make a life changing trade on nvidia anymore, and their standing in the magnificent seven is imo the most tenuous except for Tesla. I’m going to keep holding some nvidia. Just gotta keep expectations down to earth"
2025-07-16,Keep buying. It’ll be over 250 by end of year! Save my comment 😏
2025-07-16,"Buy and hold, long term still early!"
2025-07-16,"do you believe in Nvidia? If yes, then buy now and hold"
2025-07-16,No its way early. Companies are buying gpus by the millions to get in AI.
2025-07-16,"buy high, sell low"
2025-07-16,"It's too late when NVDA hits its ceiling is no more viable and has tons of competitors, and lost its moat 

I would also think NVDA is toast if Jensen ever loses his leather jacket.   The source of Jensen's mojo is that leather jacket.  

If none of that applies - then why wouldn't you buy?"
2025-07-16,Same. Also new. Only buy what you have stomach to 100% lose in a couple of days. The goal is owning the stock forever...so if you take that into account its always cheap.
2025-07-16,"Whatever happens, do not sell. I repeat: do not sell. Do not check it everyday, just hold these 5k right there for a 2-5 years at least."

2025-07-16,"100% it is too late to buy nvidia now. that is continuously true, because it is implicit, a truism."
2025-07-16,"It’s only too late if you’re looking to trade it and make fast money like a lot of people on here like to do if you’re looking to buy and hold for the long-term, then not buy it put the stock away and don’t bother with it for a good couple years at least and you’re gonna be very happy.

But I’ll reiterate again if you’re looking to trade this thing and you’re gonna be upset if it drops 1015 $20 in the next week or two or three because of some bad news in the world because of panic and fear and bullshit and manipulation in the stock market like what happens all the time they don’t buy it here wait till the next dip does that make sense?"
2025-07-16,There are 2 events ahead that could affect nvda’s price. Trump’s tariffs going into effect on August 1 and earnings report on August 23 (or thereabouts). I kind of think the window between the 2 might render a good buy in price.
2025-07-16,My Average is $95 with 100+ shares! Not buying anymore. I got 100 AVGO shares. 100+ PLTR. 500 MSTR shares. 100 RKLB shares. 100 TSMC shares. 100 ASTS shares. 100 Tesla shares. 100 JPMorgon shares. 100 CMG shares and 100 CVX shares. I invest in a lot of tech!

2025-07-16,I buy hold buy hold keep buying keep holding been inside since 2010ish
2025-07-16,You can either scale in or wait for a small pullback. Best time to invest is when there is either a broader market correction or we enter a bear market. This is usually a 10-20% decline on the S&P 500.
2025-07-16,1684 shares holding long term .

2025-07-16,"You are doing what Sir Isaac Newton done in 1720 with the South Sea. So you can be as smart as him, but if you are driven by greed and envy and play around with things you don’t really understand, and have to ask random people on Reddit, you are bound to lose your money.

Instead invest in things you understand, when the price is lower than intrinsic value. Or just DCA into a broad low cost index."
2025-07-16,Don't be a sucker and buy at an all time high wait for a good drop then buy.
2025-07-16,"No just keep buying. The horse has a lot more in it and is just getting started. With splits 10 years from now it will amount to a lot. It is just starting its next leg up. But I suspect it will stall again after earnings. It is going to be a slow grind. They cannot build them. Until that is resolved it is going to go up, fizzle, go up."

2025-07-16,"If you sell be cautious of your sell settings if you bought at different times/lots as average pnl does not always equal to your realized pnl when you sell.

2025-07-16,"Mate you're in the wrong place to be asking. On the other hand, just buy."
2025-07-17,There's only 1 Nvidia in this world and demand for data center for AI is not slowing down. Don't forget that the Mag 7 stocks all grew up to 1000s-2000s in price before splitting
2025-07-17,I thought it was overpriced at 900 USD when I started 🙈
2025-07-17,"Well I recommend you start following Jim Cramer, read his book, the Fast Money crew. learn that if you are new, start slowly, start with a tech ETF. Learn to dollar cost average. it is a series of steps, x10 doubles to 1,000,000 starting with 1000$. 90% of effort will be getting to 100,000, and 10% the 3.25 leftover doubles (100,000 x 2 x 2 x 2).  what happens if you jump as a newbie and  lose, it may scare you for years. If you jump and make money fast, it becomes a bias reinforced gambling where you can lose 90 % of everything in one night. So learn to diversify, 10-20,000 go for ETFs, and 20,000 to 100,000 start doing individual stocks.."
2025-07-21,Lol no ..not too early. The moat this company has on AI is enormous. It's got a long way to go.
2025-07-21,ChatGPT deep research (powered by Nvidia) says Nvidia will grow to $250 a share in ten years.

Never too late  in my opinion"
2025-07-16,"I have 60 shares at average of $120
Should I buy more to mess my average now if I wanna hold it long term?"
2025-07-20,"I’ve been monitoring the stock for a long time. With headlines this next week and the momentum that’s building, per Joe Tennova. I think there’s a better chance that things will just continue to edge up slowly people been waiting for the pull back but in my mind and it’s only a feel it seems that things will probably correct in fourth quarter. That’s not what usually happens. However, the passage of the reconciliation Bill has pushed everything forward. I’m not a psychic, but this is what seems to me to be the case, particularly in light of TSM‘s numbers and the anticipation that Nvidia’s margins could advance 2+ whole points due to H20s greenlighted in China."
2025-07-16,people also said it was dumb to buy when it was 90 dollars like 8wks ago thinking nvda was doomed. People are retarded and buying near ath is most likely --> retarded. Stop giving advice.
2025-07-16,Just buy more if it goes down

2025-07-16,So if I’m thinking in long term I shouldn’t wait for a pullback? Now it’s going to be above 169$ for months? After that maybe it pulls back again to 162$ and that’s it? Thanks for the reply.
2025-07-16,"Not only is this very sound advice, but if you want Nvidia you can get it in an S&P 500 fund at market weight. Due to Nvidia’s current value you’re buying a lot of Nvidia but also buying 499 other stocks. Diversification is a very good thing."
2025-07-16,"Such a big amount you should invest again only when the stock market goes through hard times, i.e. Trump messes up, wars, pandemics, new & better China tech comes out, etc, etc.. I'd say wait for the drop. If not, just invest a very small amount each month."
2025-07-16,"No it won’t? Wtf

2025-07-16,Good reply
2025-07-16,"Yea if you're thinking long term, don't worry about it. Many analysts remain bullish and have a price target of $180-$200.

If you're going short term, then wait for 5-10% dip towards 150$-160$"
2025-07-20,"Thank you for saying this! It’s so freakin annoying when people say ATH and then the next day is an ATH, and the next and then the next week… dudes, that’s the market right now. It is upward steady through this year and likely most of next  (barring some crazy attack or something psycho). ATH’s are gonna keep coming so you can get in now and get the next ATH."
2025-07-16,No. VOO only holds part of one country’s equities. VT is much more diversified.
2025-07-16,"Timing the market > blindly holding

I agree that ai is the future. But I don’t think we will see mass adoption in all sectors till at least 2030. In that time, all it takes is one bad earnings call, or an efficiency breakthrough like the deepseek drama to completely devastate the stock. I’m with you on nvidia and the future. But do I think nvidia stock will take a trip downward in the next few years? I think I do. Only holding nvidia as roughly 5 percent of my portfolio. When the tank happens I’ll be right in."
2025-07-16,"Look at BTC and ETH. If you’re scalping, AMD is a good opportunity with the China news. If not, I’d just stick to holding Nvidia long."
2025-07-16,"WTF are you talking about?!?! Keeping a low average? I bought ~$20k of Nvidia stock5 years ago ALONG WITH OTHER STOCKS AND INVESTMENTS. It’s called diversification. I’m very happy that my $20k investment in Nvidia is now worth $360k, not at all concerned about keeping a low average. Grow up you f’ing kids and learn how to invest!!"
2025-07-16,"Because the lower the average cost the higher the profit when you sell it right? 
If the average cost is high then the risk is higher of losing the money if it drops. And the profits are smaller if it doesn’t."
2025-07-16,"Uhh i wish lol
No one can predict that! If that was true I’d buy a bunch more right now lol"
2025-07-16,"At the start of the year NVDA was nearly 70% of my portfolio. It seemed foolish and so I rebalanced after the Deepseek news, making it more like 25%. I regret it of course, especially after listening to CNBC commentary the other day. Essentially they acknowledged that AI stocks are currently the best performers, and given the times we’re in, diversification may end up being the enemy of performance."
2025-07-16,To be fair analysts were giving most stocks during the Trump tariff dilemma a much lower price target. Analysts just move the price targets up or down based on new information and it’s kind of like their predictions aren’t something we should completely lean on.
2025-07-16,"Most analysts are actually pretty aligned on Nvidia when you look at the data, AI growth, demand, earnings, all that. I’m not saying you should bet everything on their opinions, but it makes sense to use that info as part of the decision."
2025-07-16,"Yeah, that’s a good option."
2025-07-16,"Of course it will, it’s a stock. The “gamble” is holding until you’ve made “enough” money. My bet is that the stock will go from the time I bought it. 

In OP’s case, I also think they’ll make money if they bought today."
2025-07-19,They are up this year bro.  You might have purchased when they were overpriced.  YTD they are +29.97%
2025-07-16,What's with the attitude?this is an investment wall not a place to act tough
2025-07-16,This is a particularly dumb variant of sunk cost fallacy. If you don't think it's worth buying you should be selling.
2025-07-16,"Did you go to school? Like elementary school? Seriously asking this. 

Each buy and sell is its own trade. Your money doesn’t care about your “average cost”, that’s just a mental tool to see whether you’re up or down on the whole position.

Your average cost is a bookkeeping thing.
Your profit is always: sell price - buy price, that is it!

If X is first buying price, Y is second buying price, and Z is the third buying price and S is selling price:

(X + Y + Z) / S = X/S + Y/S + Z/S


Every trade is its own story. You can’t erase old trades by adding new ones — you’re just adding more exposure.

You should try to focus on whether buying/selling is the best use of your money today, not to feel better about your old losing buys!"
2025-07-16,"Sure, if your goal is to maximize percent of profits. But if you believe in a company and think it will take over the whole world in 10-20 years (which I do), the way to maximize profits is to buy as much as you can as often as you can and just let it accumulate. Your average will be lower but your profits will be higher. Yes the assumption is it keeps going up, I realize that, but if you think it will and you’re trying to keep your average down, it’s sort of a ridiculous game."
2025-07-16,That's why you'll never make money. Of course it'll be $500 in a few more years.  Inflation alone drives share price.  All good stocks go up over time
2025-07-16,"Oh man, sorry to hear. The intention was good but Agreed! I think about Warren Buffett saying diversification is only for those that don’t know what they’re doing. AI seems to the newest kid on the block and I don’t think he will be going anywhere in the next 5 years, so blocking out all that “noise” you came across would be best. 

Read into their quarterly report and think about the cost of the stock relative to other great holdings you may have. It’s on a massive discount right now hence why I continue to hold and buy when possible."
2025-07-16,"True, analysts do move targets up and down when things change that’s just part of it. Sometimes there’s market manipulation going on too, But it’s still good to factor their research in."
2025-07-16,"Agreed on consistency in projecting positive growth, but specific price targets in a time frame is simply a guess."
2025-07-16,"Yes, but specific investment advice should be tailored to your needs and circumstances."
2025-07-16,"They are likely to make money yes. My point is that nvidia is already the largest company in the world. 4 trillion dollars. The amount that company would need to grow for just a 2x is so insane that it can’t happen for minimum a decade

My belief that we are heading to a worldwide recession probably biases my opinion towards negativity I’ll admit. I think the stock market is overall way too high, middle class all over the world are struggling. Savings are at an all time low. Debt and inflation are at massive highs. 

The house of cards is awfully tall now, and nvidia will suffer a lot more than the other mag7 companies who at least sell products to everyday consumers."
2025-07-16,"So basically lower the buying cost the higher potential of profit when the stock goes up. Thats what I said bruh.
If my average cost is $125 compared to someone with same amount of stocks at $5 average, its obvious that I will make less than him."
2025-07-16,Problem is that no one can be sure if it will keep going up. I’d buy a bunch more right now if that was the case
2025-07-16,"No, you didn’t. You said profits are smaller or bigger depending on the stock goes up or down. No, the profit would be the same. 

Your profit doesn’t change because your average is changed now, you just made a profit again, the second time. Because, the second time you bought, you made another transaction and you made a profit. Each time you buy, each time you make a new profit or loss. 

Doesn’t matter you buy the same stock or you buy a stock or gold or crypto whatever. You either make a profit or loss, your average does not matter!"
2025-07-16,"Yeah well that’s certainly the answer you need to find, if you feel it’s risky then hold, but if you’re like most people in this sub we think it’ll be 500 in a decade or so. So an easy keep buying and let it sit produces the most money if that happens. No need to time anything , just DCA all the time"
2025-07-16,"You would get average of twice much profit from VOO instead of VT based on histoical result. VT more of a safe net, so it's slightly safer"

if the stock goes up, it means i am selling it at a new higher price. Meaning more profit than what I could have had if it had not gone up."
2025-07-16,How about investing in both? Or better to just do one?
2025-07-16,"Because, it is the same! You’d make profit again, but not because you lowered the average, it is because the stock price went up. The average has nothing to do with the profit you make. 

Average is just a number for you to understand how you do with the certain stock because people tend to buy the same stock on several occasions. 

Imagine you buy a stock 100 times a year and assume that the stock price change crazy. In order for you to understand whether you make profit or loss in general, you check the average! 

I don’t know why you don’t understand this. Always focus on whether you should buy or sell. Do not try to lower the average. If you think the current price is low than what it should, you buy. If it is high, you sell. That is it!"
2025-07-16,"I would invest in both. I typically hear people saying to invest in VOO more than VT, but investing both is a sound strategy"
2025-07-16,"It would be stupid to take my advice just because I said so, but I am smarter than these other Reddit dummies. You should consult an accredited financial advisor, which I am not."
2025-07-16,"And the fifteen years before that, international stocks destroyed VOO. If you are this consumed by recency bias, you shouldn’t be investing."

“Market observers also note that even the 190,000 shares sold in June (worth $28.7 million) are insignificant compared to the CEO's holdings of $130 billion”

Yet you mentioned it on the title for clickbait."

2025-07-17,"This sounds like a response you would get from a model.  Nvidia is king growing horizontally and more importantly vertically .  They probably have a model trained on the technology there building and so they can ask it what other industries they can dominate in. They are top notch in innovation, recruiting,  strategy, marketing, etc... The list goes on. When you have a company that only hires the best at every thing. Your probably going to see good results.  AI engineers at Nvidia get paid way more money then I've seen at any other organization.  Salary plus shares.  You work their and you can retire early most likely."

2025-07-15,"If you’re in a position to pay those taxes and you like to day trade, I am all for it.  Unknown is how many shares were purchased.  I don’t hold anything against anyone doing with their money as they please.  Also money not in the market isn’t growing profit.  The gamble is sell and hold that cash until it dips & that could be a few months"
2025-07-21,"it could depend how diverse your portfolio is and how long you want to wait for a dip, and what  level of profit you want to yank out at?

like 15% profits or dips? or 20% maybe?

  
I think if you got 15 stocks, I'd say always dip around with 5% of anything you really like"

I think there will be another upside once the Fed starts cutting interest rates. While it will be a broader upside, with the reports of $5-7 trillion dollars in mutual funds setting on the sidelines, as rates drop money will start moving into the market."

Then hold for the rest of the ride."
2025-07-15,"Ok I just found out that nvda will jump directly to 172 today as the market opens. The closing price yesterday was 164. So if I put an order rn(while the market is closed.) at market price which is 164, will it be executed at 164 or when the market opens ? Will it instead buy the shares at the new opening price today which is 172 dollars?


I asked GPT about this and it said no. What do u guys think?"
2025-07-15,"When do you reckon should be a good time to invest? Because I bought at 150 it went down to 131 so just constantly bought as it dipped and waited to turn a profit before selling at areound 165

Will it go down to 100 at any point?"

2025-07-15,Yall been saying a pullback for a month now lol why would we pullback after this great news ?
2025-07-15,I think this news will trigger upgrades from a bunch of Banks. To expect it to go to $5 trillion again in a few months though ermm I’m not sure about that. If Trump doesn’t back down from tariffs the entire market is going to go down again.
2025-07-15,"What do you think somebody would sell their 172$ worth of stocks for 164$?

This is just common sense, doesn't require ChatGPT at all.

Your market order will be placed in and nobody would pick it up (because it is not a fair exchange rn) so it would sit in the book until the price comes even close to it."
2025-07-15,No.  Depending on how you set the parameters you’ll either buy at 172 or the order just won’t go through at all.
2025-07-15,it will depends on the price at market open. if you are going to buy i suggest you after the buy to not look at the stock for 1 month
2025-07-15,"did some like that last week, if you lucky they catch it at the first second of opening then it jumps to the real value, so I am joining you and we will see"
2025-07-16,It will sell at the opening price.

2025-07-18,"Which is another opportunity to buy low. Its not a bad thing...its what we do, buy low, buy low, buy low, sell high, or hold for higher highs. He isnt stupid. These people know what they're doing contrary to the lefts opinion."
2025-07-15,Looks like it could hit $200 in a month or two. And to think that’s only 17% away.
2025-07-15,Haha Forreal I just said a month cause he couldn’t deny that one 😂 I’ve been holding since 2021 brotha
2025-07-18,"Indeed, it's why i said people. When I said trump, we were speaking of tariffs and that too affects the market. 
Anyhow, buy low, sell high. Goodluck"
2025-07-15,120-140 was its natural place until a few factors- external- drove it down. So in reality it’s only come up from 130ish to 165ish in nearly a year

It’s more like 30% than 60%+ but still, that is a juicy gain."
2025-07-17,$200 in 2025!
2025-07-15,"All I can say is the harder something shoots up and the more hype it gets the more it rebounds. Long term very bullish but people talked about being $145 bag holders think about 170+. Look at how nvidia has been in the past it’s gone from 145->120 in very fast timespans. 

I hope people actually believe in the company and hold on otherwise someone is going to lose a lot of money in the short term."

I do have the feeling it will continue it's upward trend, though not as aggressively as the past years. Of course there may be recessions in it's value also, there's no way around the volatile nature of this stock and sector. But - I'm a regular guy who lucked into this stock because I've long been a user of their products and believed in them. I am not to be trusted as a stock analyst. I invest for the long term b/c I'm not smart enough to be a trader. I don't hold at all costs... I sell when this stock becomes too high of a percentage of my overall portfolio... with an eye toward tax optimization as well. The amount I hold in my IRA stays there without change."
2025-07-16,I hit a quarter of a million today after only being invested in NVIDIA for 3.5 years. I am a long hold as well. I believe Jenson will continue to innovate as he has done up to now.

2025-07-15,Nvidia got the green light to resume sales to China

2025-07-15,So what if it does? Are you selling today?  And why?
2025-07-15,"Nope. Sold my PLTR yesterday. Made $4k. Will possibly buy more nvidia today after the announcement of being allowed to sell to China again.

Looks like trumps inside crowd were the buyers yesterday."

2025-07-15,"Investing is gambling enough. Though admittedly it's not that much of a gamble right now.

Thing is...when you're investing, you're IN the game. When you do options, you FOLLOW the game. I want to be in the game."
2025-07-15,"No, I'm someone who's made a shit ton doing plain 'ol boring retail investing....mostly swing.

$NVDA just announced it’s bringing back H20 GPU sales to China, and this time, they’re doing it with a new, China-approved chip called the RTX Pro GPU.

They’re waiting on final approval from the U.S. government, but deliveries are expected soon. The new chip is designed for AI tasks like smart factories and logistics, and fully meets China’s rules.

CEO Jensen Huang even met with leaders in the U.S. and China to keep the AI conversation going and show Nvidia’s support for global cooperation.

2025-07-15,"Ok I just found out that nvda will jump directly to 172 today as the market opens. The closing price yesterday was 164. So if I put an order rn(while the market is closed.) at market price which is 164, will it be executed at 164 or when the market opens ? Will it instead buy the shares at the new opening price today which is 172 dollars?

Tomorrow may be fun. After hours big time green"
2025-07-15,When do I short nvidia then? 🤔
2025-07-15,I think it is for the best. It is much better for US to sell GPU to China rather than risking a Chinese firm developing some that might overtake NVIDIA. I hope it doesn’t be like how AMD overtook Intel.

2025-07-15,"Yes, I'm well aware they do a shit ton more than AI. I'm a gamer first and foremost and have been buying their cards ever since my first GeForce 7900 GS SLI setup. In 2014 when I first purchased their stock, they were getting their feet wet with self driving car software/hardware and data center which also had and still has great potential 

My linked comment about AI just highlights the point that in 2017 I was seeing them positioning themselves to be the leaders of the AI sector as it was being born and saw the potential of the enormous revenue stream that would come with it. I knew it wasn't all Nvidia did, but saw how big of a portion of the business it was about to become."

I had a 3dfx card too, can't remember the name but was playing Myst, Falcon 4.0 and Microsoft flight simulator on Windows 95. It's crazy to compare that to the most recent gaming trend I'm getting into which is using Nvidia's GeForce Now streaming service playing games on my Steam Deck, Nvidia Shield TV.

I also use 2x leveraged products like NVDL/NVDG on days I think NVDA is going to pop (to lock in upside and act as a hedge against loss of profits vis a vis NVDY which requires steady but not drastic growth).    NVDG showed me a field day when they annouced H20 back in business in China."
2025-07-15,"If you sell on option for a year you are locking yourself to holding the 100 shares and if something happens and you would wanna sell you are locked in
If you sell and these become uncovered calls and the stock continues to soar it could wipe you badly"
2025-07-15,You can close the sold call at any time but yes to sell the shares you’d need to close the option. This is supposed to be an alternative to selling the shares
2025-07-16,"If you can close, how does that work? The buyer of your options is forced to
Sell it back to you? Or you have to find a new seller for the same option on the market? What if there are no sellers or the spread is crazy high"
2025-07-16,"The options trade starts with you as the seller getting connected to a buyer on the open market. It’s like when you go to buy and sell your shares, you put on order on the market and someone who is willing to take the other side completes the trade. 

When it’s time to close, you do the same thing and take your option back out on the open market. The other side of your trade does not need to be closed by the same person who was on the other side before, someone just has to be willing to take the other side. 

Options have less liquidity and are harder to trade sometimes with wider spreads, so it’s important to choose an options contract others are trading."

2025-07-15,"Oh ok, we'll go with that.  Hey everyone...all you strangers....should I sell when I'm up?  I mean do you buy low and sell high or should I wait and maybe make more or wait and maybe lose money or maybe go get an ice cream and turn over my investing decisions to an adult until I grow up.  Yea that could he it also.  Even if you don't realize it, you are looking for others to cosign on to your choice.  It happens to most folks, it's just we don't have to hide from it.  Sharing ingredients the risk, blame and so on is a very normal and human thing to do."

2025-07-14,I would sell
2025-07-14,Take your profit

2025-07-15,"It's in the screenshot. 

$4.30 x 100 x 4 = $1,720‬

$15.45 x 100 x 4 = $6,180

$6,180 - $1,720 = $4,460 net profit.

Of course if NVDA tanked and didn't hit the breakeven he'd have lost his $1,720."
2025-07-15,Not true. He coulda rolled to a higher strike. This would lock in profit and give him back the upside

2025-07-14,Yeah this market is so damn unpredictable. So I'll just take the profit
2025-07-14,If 4k is big money for you then take profit. If it represents very little and you don't mind loosing you can keep gambling. Watch for market open signals.
2025-07-15,Take out 1k and buy calls before the earnings at 1 month out just below the strike price
2025-07-15,"Now. Today is that moment when you should have held. But did you know nvda will be allowed to sell in China? You didn't. Yes you lost some 2k possible gains. But you have 4k in your hands. If Jensen would have said it takes more time to sell H20, the market would have corrected.

Don't be bitter. Don't get greedy. Be happy with small but constant gains."
2025-07-14,The US gov also pulled the H20 after it being approved to sell. Once delivered it can be considered the sale was given the green light. Acting in its companies’ best interest is not what the US gov does nowadays and the slightest bit of fear will have them pull the approval.

2025-07-14,"The stock market and the economy are two different things entirely, that have some overlap. But they are different. Many people don't fully understand this.

And negatively correlated in the short term, according to empirical research.

Cisco has been a great company for the last 20 years, and we even need their hardware for the upcoming AI boom. But they aren't a trillion-dollar company.

Intel actually has fabs, unlike Nvidia, yet it has a circa 100b mkt cap. Intel also has a small share of the GPU market, as well as a foothold in the CPU market they are competing with AMD for.

Intel and Nvidia revenue arent' even that far apart. But look at their market caps."

However the consequence is that before two more years we find ourselves in an AI arms race with China that causes poor decision-making to occur that puts us all at risk.

2025-07-14,"they can’t do a shit to him, Jensen got too much power over US microeconomics as US companies keep buying his chips, but also macroeconomics as Nvidia is the biggest tax milker for US gov. If they touch him one bit, he’ll move to China and that’s the US senators biggest nightmare. Their greedy and unprofessional ass is going to be humbled by Jensen as he is the one dictating the rules of the game here. That’s why he is smart and rich and they’re just government puppets."
2025-07-14,"yeah but neither you or I wouldn’t take a flight in a damn Chinese plane, unless you paid me a million bucks lol. So why would I want to buy Chinese chips if I can buy Nvidia’s ones that are the best quality? As a company owner, I need to manage a risk and have stable cash flow."
2025-07-12,"Did I read the wrong memo?  NVDA ditched their SOUNDHOUND holdings if I'm not mistaken back when the stock was around 15.  I got out then.

""Nvidia revealed a stake in SoundHound in early 2024, which sent its stock soaring. But Nvidia recently sold its entire position, and SoundHound stock is now trending lower.Jul 4, 2025""

2025-07-13,"Lol.  NVDA working in cahootz with Whoring Kitty and the Wall Street Bets crowd to day trade Soundhound.  

Come on man that's not how this works.

They buy shares and stake in a company to profit off innovation and have a stake in the direction of the company.   

Not sure why they bailed out...  NVDA is probably looking to triple down on robotics as the next big thing.   Their AI development is on Autopilot now."

2025-07-12,I keep buying other stocks thinking I don’t need any more nvidia. But my nvidia stocks keep going up higher and my value stocks can’t keep up compared to nvidia.
2025-07-12,Buy
2025-07-12,"The secret is buy high, sell low. 

NVDA is $166 now. It will inevitably crash again. Oct 2024 saw a high of $138 and Feb 2025 it crashed to $108, a 21% crash. 

Feb 2022 saw a high of $27, October 2022 saw it crash to $17, a 37% crash.

Meaning it wouldn’t be surprising if NVDA saw a crash to $120 (just like it also wouldn’t be surprising if it hit $185, either)

If that kind of volatility triggers you to panic sell (buy high, sell low), then I wouldn’t invest in NVDA. "
2025-07-12,"Start by buying etfs - preferably VOO and build a solid base.

Once you feel ready to purchase individual stocks, look for stocks that pay at least a 3% dividend and have been increasing their dividend for at least the past 20 years and have solid long term performance and fundamentals. Learn to reinvest dividends and build your positions over time. This will get you building solid portfolios and understanding what makes a good business. 

Only after building a solid portfolio, should you begin to take some speculative plays. Do plenty of research. Understand what you are investing in. Understand who is running the company, what’s the vision, what’s the path to growth and who’s backing the company. Never put all your eggs in one basket. Ideally you’re finding companies that you could potentially hit a home run in but still have solid fundamentals. NVDA is not likely one of those anymore - it’s not going to 5x or 10x anytime soon. You’ll have plenty of NVDA in your VOO positions anyways."
2025-07-12,"Very simple.. buy low sell high, bro. Never go wrong!"

2025-07-12,"General rule of thumb is to invest 10-20% of your take home pay. Consistency is much more when it comes to investing so find an amount that you can regularly set aside and invest. 

Profitability isn’t a guarantee, investing comes with inherent risks. There is no guarantee that the stock market or any individual stock will continue to go up in value. That’s why diversifying and looking for companies that have consistent long term performance is key."

2025-07-14,Realistically what would be price per share at a 10T market cap?
2025-07-11,"I always thought that, and I still think that. However, I did get scorched the Friday of the week the tariffs were announced. Since I use leverage, I have to be careful, so I sold before it reached bottom, and started buying back  in the $84 range, along with Broadcom in the $155-$160 range. I stuck with half of my former NVDA position because I had bought down all the way to $90, as it was tanking, and so my position was insanely overweight. The rate of decline, just below $90, I lost my nerve, simply because I couldn’t find a reason, so capitulation it was!!! Two large, but reasonable positions in NVDA and AVGO richly are paying off. So I had 8,800 shares of NVDA, with an average price of approx $110. I took a substantial beating, until I felt the perceived capitulation end and rebuilt. Buying down always worked, until it didn’t. That was one of my toughest trading days ever. I usually don’t have much emotion trading, but that day caused me a dread I haven’t felt trading in a long time. That day hardened me enough where the market could lose half its value and I will use it as an opportunity to buy."

Bob fucked up royally, every one remember BOB THE FOOL. It just comes off as unnecessary self-soothing. NVDA's great guys, I get this is the NVDA sub, but it probably won't rocket straight to 200$. It will go up and down.

2025-07-11,My feelings after having nvda for more than 10 years. It’s a strong buy more than ever before.
2025-07-11,"Not buying but resisting the urge to sell.



Jensen had a meeting with Trump Thursday, before heading to China today. While I don't expect a change to Nvidia in the chip restriction, I'm still hoping that they can get an export license to sell something to China. That would get a bump up in price. 



I bought before, and shortly after, the stock split. Sold those holdings for a $30k profit. Bought 2900 shares again with an average price of $136. Sold 400 at 150 to get me back to a three year cash (mostly SWVXX) in reserve. Now setting on 2500 shares and a $75k profit. Resisting pulling the trigger to lock in the gain. 

  
In June of 2018 the wife and I had a combined $250k in IRA's. Since then, we have withdrawn $200k and at the beginning of this week our combined balance hit $500k and looking right now it's up to $517k. $17k in a week."
2025-07-11,Well that’s totally up to you. This should be a learning moment about completely getting out of a position all at once without a very good reason. So when I have a stock like NVDA I always figure my move will be the wrong one so instead of selling all I trim say 15\20% and sit back and watch. If my sell was correct and the stock pulls back I make my next decision..buy or sell more.
2025-07-11,"BUY THE DIP! It has to come down again briefly. Then you load up. May go back down mid to high 140's then rocket back up to near 200's.

2025-07-11,Just think 4 trillion market cap. How much more can it go? To move trillions you need huge amount of movement and revenue. I’d wager it’ll go back down to 3.5 trillion by September and then go back to 4.5 trillion by 2026 January. So yes dip to 130-140s for testing support is inevitable.

2025-07-12,Impossible to predict where NVDIA goes next but hard to argue it won’t go higher. Although no company too big to fail and completion is getting steeper as tends to be the case when any company gets big enough. Why actively testing it only way I’m comfortable. Rather miss out than lose out. Others have higher risk tolerances or just assume there’s no ceiling. Some talk themselves into believing it can fail by only  seeing the positive in every bit of data and ignoring the potential obstacles. Due diligence and thinking for oneself usually best approach vs asking the internet because fact is we really don’t know.

Sure, we might hit 175 before, but there’s with 100 % certainty a wider market downturn coming that’ll take this down to 125-130 again. If you’ve been here a few years you know I’m right."
2025-07-11,"Stock is going up, obviously a bunch of people is buying."
2025-07-11,"Sell low-buy high, huh? Figure out what NVDA is worth and buy low-sell high instead. You're not ready for day trading yet"
2025-07-11,"I say buy now. Who knows how much higher it can go. If you wait for a pull back, you’re basically buying at the current price. For example, if it goes to $175 and pulls back, most likely it will drop to current levels which is $167."
2025-07-11,"Bought a little over 200 shares at 100’sh, still sitting on them and at this point I think it’s a little pricey to get in. 

I do think it will hit 250 at some point but maybe there is a correction coming first."
2025-07-11,"No, I have my dca down so I don’t want to mess with it and I don’t want to sell"
2025-07-11,Too extended to buy at this point
2025-07-11,I’m never selling and DCAing
2025-07-11,The answers will differ wildly on what timeline and trade modes you're operating. HODL? Day trading? Short term?
2025-07-11,Man it depends on how much you want to buy and how long you want to keep?
2025-07-11,"Yes. I buy every week. It’s going over $200 in a few months and I’ll probably sell then, but for now, I still think it’s a solid buy"
2025-07-11,Nvda casually pumping 60b market cap (Mercedes Benz is 60b) on a day thats supposed to be deep red 😂
2025-07-11,"I own too many NVDA shares and still want to buy more. I want to get leap calls instead of shares. But it keeps going up everyday so I'm waiting out. 1 thing for sure is this beast doesn't stop at this level so if you hold for long term 1 year+, I say buy it on a red day."
2025-07-11,Yes if you plan to hold it. If you plan to buy now sell when a dip happens then stay away.
2025-07-12,"Im just yolo personally, but you could technically deposit your spare money but dont invest, and once some natural disaster occurs and the price dives down, you could go all in too 😁"
2025-07-12,You have to be patient. NVDA is going to hit 170 for sure. 180-190 is the projected number however once it hits that I think people are going to start buying where it reaches 200. You have to be patient. Buy it 6 months out and just hold
2025-07-12,Someone is buying duh!
2025-07-12,Somebody’s buying. #SupplyAndDemand
2025-07-12,"161.98 on that little dip yesterday, but only 12 extra shares.
Have taken profits previously several times at much lower prices. Current average on 72 shares is at 156. Trying to hold long term."
2025-07-12,"I am like you. I sold majority of my NVDA shares around 147.  The only problem about waiting for the dip is that the dip might be at a higher price. When NVDA was around 140, lots of people thought it was high and said wait for the dip.  I bet you if NVDA drops to 145 next week, everyone will think this is the dip and load up. So hindsight, 140 wasn’t high.  If you have conviction about this company, just add as you go.  I think you are in good hands in you keep investing with the #1 company in the world. If NVDA falls, the world will crumble. 😁"
2025-07-12,Just do what you think is right and don't look back.  If you're wrong pivot.  If you're right stick with it.  Don't look for investment alive on the internet from steangerd.
2025-07-12,Sell cash secured put(s) at a strike you’d be willing to pay for.
2025-07-12,"The question that has been asked for years and those that said they were not left something on the table.

At this point I will look for a pul back but if the data show strength then I will buy."
2025-07-12,"NVDA will eventually suffer slower growth rates. Doesnt mean they won’t grow but within the next couples years we will see growth investors move on to other stocks as NVDA becomes a value stock. It’s likely a good place to have money but there are going to be much better opportunities, especially at these prices."
2025-07-12,I bought at 136 with the long-term plan to sell at 200.
2025-07-12,"im waiting it out, i also sold at $145, I would have had $28,000 more if I just waited and did not sell.

I got impatient"
2025-07-12,"I'm operating with a European broker, after this year's performance of the Dollar, even considering that I bought at 96$ if I sell now it would be like selling at around 140$. So yes, I'm waiting"
2025-07-12,"At 166, I know it will be 200 in due time. Once it’s 200 I know it’ll be 250, then 300 etc etc. and plan to hold it way further into the future. I’m yolo-ING all my funds INTO nvda"
2025-07-12,Sure lotsa people that’s why the price keeps going up!!
2025-07-12,"Yes, bought 10k yesterday because these are infant prices."
2025-07-12,I bought a few shares to celebrate the 4T cap. Long time believer from before the AI days
2025-07-12,I am locked and loaded w 3300 shares
2025-07-12,"Buy 100 shares at the current price and then sell a 45 dte ATM call for around $15 odd, effectively cushioning you till 150, which is a good price point to enter anyway.  If not assigned, repeat the call sell.   If assigned, repeat the cycle. 

Best of both worlds"
2025-07-12,buy when it dips.. that stupid thing remained at 144 for 7 damn months
2025-07-12,"Don't buy anymore. Clearly you lost confidence by selling and not a whole has changed since that time, so why would you buy now?"
2025-07-12,Call me crazy but I treat it as an aggressive S&P investment. Just let it chill
2025-07-12,I am selling put options every week. Nice premium.
2025-07-12,IM ALWAYS BUYING. Every week. DCA bich
2025-07-12,"I just keep buying. It just broke out and is still in a buy zone. I was not buying earlier. But it seems to be back on the move and a good play since mid April. However, institutional buying is weak. So I am cautious."
2025-07-12,"The road for Nvidia is a long one.

YES."
2025-07-12,Holding on for $200
2025-07-12,"Depends, are you trying to sell your entire position next Monday? I have automated buys every 2 weeks, dont plan on touching until I retire lol"
2025-07-12,For every buyer there is a seller
2025-07-12,"I remember when it was at $70 and my buddy and I said it was too expensive to buy.
Look at it now"
2025-07-12,"You always need your own price target. That requires some work, of course. Once you establish - using data and your own beliefs - what the price should be, then you go shopping. You can choose to buy even if the market is overpricing relative to your price. You also shouldn’t second guess (too much) if the market is far below your target. You can adjust and pace your investment as well. 

With that said - I’ve believed earlier this year that NVDA is worth 180-200 at least. I came on NVDA later than most ppl here. It’ll keep growing from here. I’m long. With that price target, sure it’s still a buy for me. However, the market is hot and gets jittery. NVDA is always hot and is the first 4T company that ppl need to get used to. There’s a risk that a small shock will send it right down. Or - maybe enough people have bought into it now that it can’t be shaken for a while. Those market dynamics deserve some consideration even though it’s still a buy IMO. As others said, I tend to agree in only going in with what you can stay without for years.

Hope that helps."
2025-07-12,If you’re not DCA it may be risky buying at an ATH. The stock is now overbought. I’d recommend waiting for the next dip and buying then
2025-07-12,"No. First off, it’s the biggest position in my portfolio- by a stupid margin - and not selling. I do have calls I bought when it was around $125/$130 that I will close out next week.

Second, even though I believe strongly in the company and its future, Wall Street sentiments are a fickle thing. I will wait for a pull back to buy (my last purchase of the stock was at $106). 

Again, not buying, but not selling either."
2025-07-12,Yes I will. I sold out last week when my stop loss triggered. Mayer $116k AUD. Will buy back in and keep a tight stop loss.
2025-07-13,Been holding my 200 shares since about 30. Wrote a few call options and my cost basis is about 5 now.  I am holding because they have the numbers to support it and that’s not counting on future stuff they are working on.
2025-07-13,YOU NEVER SELL STOCKS AT ALL TIME HIGH !! WHEN IT RETESTS YOU BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY
2025-07-13,"Next time definitely be more strategic. Because now not only did you donate to Uncle Sam, but buying back in at a higher price (losing an additional 15% gain).

As others have said definitely get back in. AI and quantum are next big revolutions"
2025-07-13,"Great company good mid long term
Hold, I’m personally waiting for a pull back could hit 200 before it does no one knows."
2025-07-13,"I was in on April 4th at $94. I'm at the other end, considering selling now."
2025-07-13,"She’s going to $220 why sell it hasn’t even started moving yet 
Year to date"
2025-07-13,Sold at 165$ and chillin
2025-07-13,Buy VGT.
2025-07-14,"I have seen NVIDIA going back from 145 to 86, the sentiment on that stock can change within days. Not buying, not selling atm."
2025-07-14,"Not sure what you're using to decide when to buy and sell, I don't think any of the normal sell indicators triggered when it hit 145.  If you're just winging it, you should stop, develop a system or you should just hold long term."
2025-07-14,I buy multiples of QQQ1 / look at its performance - has Nvdia in it and pays 14% dividend !!! SPY1 good too-tied in with S and P
2025-07-15,"Neg divergence on daily, higher price lower rsi. Perhaps short term dip?"
2025-07-11,Buy and hold
2025-07-12,"This is the only appropriate way. 

Making FOMO decisions based on today’s price is just gambling."
2025-07-12,A good strategy for long-term investment for a great stock with unstoppable growth for at least 5 years.
2025-07-11,Yepp it's not going anywhere in the next 10 years but up. Who cares if it floats around a couple percentage short term
2025-07-12,This a good strategy especially if you believe in the company long term. But again I believe a lot of retail investors aren’t doing their due diligence on what they  are investing in most of the time. Sometimes it pays slightly more to just wait a month or two but that is timing the markets.
2025-07-12,Curious how much you hold? I don’t have a ton of money and basically I wonder what percentage of my investable income should I put to this opposed to some safer etf
2025-07-13,1000%! Always long game u will never win day trading just like gambling highs and lows but in the end 99% end up losing
2025-07-14,Big buying opportunity then -
2025-07-11,If everyone buys ‘The Dip’ they aren’t substantial without bad news. And if there’s bad news then wait for a big move.
2025-07-12,"Im getting up there - have all my shit together in life, so I am holding long term for my kids - that’s how much I believe in it."
2025-07-12,"maybe even sooner. usually before earnings people get scared and price drops 

aug is also trump tariffs, we ll see"
2025-07-11,"Truth I bought at 124, it’s taken a year to really start making some money , and I’ve also seen how fast bad sentiment in the market rip away all of it in a couple days 💯 if you don’t have the discipline to hold through the tariff sell off and deep seek sell off and alllll those type of things that have happened , then I wouldn’t buy now . Not because I don’t think it’s going to go up , but because it’s inevitable that volatility will come and that shit gets stressful ."
2025-07-11,"Lol same, I was hoping for a dip to buy even more, but sadly it goes up, and I feel its gonna stay that way until a Giant recession or hiccup happens"
2025-07-11,You can sell a November $155 put to get back in at $145 again
2025-07-11,thanks. this a good idea. I can't be productive at work with this insane agony twisted into fomo. I will buy two shares for now and see how it pans out.
2025-07-15,"are you still waiting? Its $170 and the FOMO is getting insane.   
i feel im being left on the side line after selling at 145"
2025-07-15,does this still apply today? upset price spiked today
2025-07-12,"This is what I said to someone worried about NVDA short-term price action back in 2017 and look where we are now  ( http://stocktwits.com/mikel3113/message/71190466 ) Nothing has changed in the outlook. The momentum has been piling up for years. While every good thing comes to an end, now's not the time to bet against Nvidia. This has been Nvidia's long-term plan for years and it's just now hitting it's stride"
2025-07-12,Between 2-3k shares scattered across multiple accounts. Enough to be thankful but not enough to quit working haha. I keep a 401k funded as well separately
2025-07-12,I guess AMD (NVDA has the superior chips) and TSLA (autonomous vehicles and Optimus are still in the works) would be considered the underdogs in AI.
2025-07-11,The pandemic days were one of the best eras to invest because there was no interest rates and the relief money we got from covid was used to invest in stocks. They say people still have money from those checks and are using that to pump the market. I would compare this to the start of the internet era where all the big tech companies took over the market and have been beating the rest of the sp500 companies. The mag 7 are still the best companies to invest and I think will continue to beat the other companies
2025-07-15,Earning report is Aug 27 - if it’s positive price will likely shoot up… hopefully it will come down before that
2025-07-11,"Nobody sees the dip until after it happens 

Nobody knows what obstacles may arise

Nobody knows what opportunities are to come

Nobody knows anything

Good luck to everyone."
2025-07-12,Yeah your absolutely right. I said September because usually it’s the most bearish month of the year lol. But August 1 will test market with tarif. Could be end of July too
2025-07-12,"just look at last year graph, was any of that predictable?"
2025-07-11,Literally nothing. This shit is going to $200.
2025-07-15,"Yikes, I just saw the huge AH spike. I still have a good holding, but like you, sold some at $155. I’m now reconsidering if now is the time to buy back in…will there be a pull back? It traded sideways for almost a year and did have some major pullbacks. Sorry, my crystal ball is foggy!"
2025-07-12,Jensen Huang and his two colleagues sat at Denny’s Restaurant to conceive the idea of setting up a company to make 3D graphic cards for personal computers in 1993.  Nvidia grew to 1 trillion company in 2023.  In just two years Nvidia has become a 4 trillion company and the largest corporation by market capitalisation.  The track record is phenomenal.  I have been a long-term investor for Nvidia and have bought more shares this week.   I experienced the volatility of this stock before the advent of ChatGPT and lost money during that period.  I kept buying on the dip and hold on my portfolio and ultimately my portfolio has increased multiple times.  I see Nvidia as a long-term investment and won’t worry about a temporary dip.
2025-07-13,Yup should be solid for next 2 to 5 years and longer just depending on pipe line of products.  Hard part is keep making that much profit ever day and get new stuff.  Hard to stay at the top time will tell I am keeping my 200
2025-07-12,Nice man. That’s a good chunk. Yeah I’m late to the game with all sorts of investing but I’m throwing in what I can.
2025-07-12,"AMD has been bad all year. really rough. still hasn't come close to matching the peak despite everything else in tech going bananas, so yes a very very big underdog ha"
2025-07-12,"Agree. Wait til rates start dropping... We'll see a decent boost I believe as money leaves money markets and savings accounts for more risky investments, NVDA being one of them."
2025-07-14,I sold out 1/2 my positions 3/20/20 / bad choice / had lots of blue chips / would have made huge profit fast forward
2025-07-15,Their earnings report is Aug 27.  They’re saying that if it’s positive which it likely will be the stock price can shoot up again up to 180….
2025-07-12,"Thanks. Are you referring to RSI or Stochastic? From what I'm seeing, NVDA's RSI is around 62 (not quite overbought yet), and MACD is positive at about 1.63, so I’m thinking more upside. For the Nasdaq divergence, do you mean something like bearish divergence where the index is hitting new highs but momentum indicators aren't keeping up?"
2025-07-12,Too bad it wasn’t a waffle house or this could be an 8T company by now…
2025-07-12,"Step 1, eat at Denny’s

Step 2, ????

Step 3, profit and bro down"
2025-07-14,I had AMD in a structured investment at 17% interest/ 40% downside / came due mid April - I got hammered- up now 40 points from then 😢
2025-07-12,"I don’t know much about QCOM other than the fact that it’s a tech company and it’s part of my SOXL etf. If you look at the top 10 holdings in SOXL, all of them are essential for the future, but I think NVDA and AMD are probably the 2 most important ones."
2025-07-12,"True I also believe once we start cutting interest rates, the markets are going to rally like we’ve never even seen before.

This revolution will be bigger than all the others combined. Every bull run we’ve had has lasted longer than all the rest before it. Last bull run lasted a little more than 10 years from 2009-2020. This new one will last longer."
2025-07-12,"I have a friend who sells covered calls on stocks and swears the incremental revenues is worth it. But he misses out on the big run-ups because it always “feels” expensive to buy at a higher price than you paid earlier. 

Human psychology and stock markets (or gambling. Or math. Lots of things) really fucks with you. 

I’d like to trim NVDA and AVGO just because they are on such a heater. I said the same about BTC - but who the hell knows.  

Wild times. 

The world is certainly changing fast - in the back drop of chaos."
2025-07-11,"True. I use to sit and attempt timing the market, But then i would be anxious and sit their ALL day thinking damn, shoulda bought in. I've moved more into ETFS now due to this issue. Although I do still have a couple solo stocks I want to hold, such as NVDA."
2025-07-11,"I tried that 2 times with calls on Carnival about 3 years ago. First one I landed 200$ positive, was like hell yea, 2nd one landed -30$. And i was like nahhhh... this shit stressing me tf out. So I haven't traded since."
2025-07-11,"Personally, I think they gonna be around for Years to come. Now are they gonna pull an Amazon, and go from 160$ to almost 4k on the exchange, I don't think so. But I could Totally see them hitting possibly 250 this year alone, and maybe somewhere between 500-1000 in a couple years. But I feel they gonna keep going up for sure. 


Especially with their market cap being over 4 trillion now and being biggest company, they definitely got gas in the tank. Only fear i guess is because AI is somewhat unpredictable, TECHNICALLY another company could compete with them. But with how large of a portion they have in AI, they'd probably buy or acquire anyone threatening them.

I guess the real question is after AI, what's the next big thing?"
2025-07-11,Time to buy if appropriate price drop
2025-07-11,"The market is behaving irrationally despite the current inflation induced tariffs.

2025-07-17,i stand corrected. 180 might be a low target :D
2025-07-11,"I wonder if NVDA.has the ability raise prices to existing customers in response to tariffs or is it likely under contract at fixed prices (meaning it would have to eat the loss)? Again, I realize we are talking about Taco so nothing may come of this but if it did . . ."
2025-07-12,25% would be fantastic as a buying opportunity considering it will bounce back regardless of tariffs.
2025-07-12,"That’s only down to 125, I believe we see 120’s again tbh. Nvidia is one of the most volatile stocks and has times of shooting straight up… and straight down. And would be a pretty decent buying opportunity"
2025-07-14,"If this stock goes down to $125 I will buy. I feel like depending on the events we can get different numbers. I.e NVDA dipping to $120’s, then the teens and even the hundreds and below. I don’t see it dipping in the teens unless a geo political or technological issue come up"
2025-07-12,Have cash. Willing to buy. Even 10% is good for my cash.

2025-07-13,They lose 300k$ per sold car. Why use this comment to use other for exit liquidity?
2025-07-11,I’m with you. Everyone will down vote but I was buying INTC under $20

2025-07-11,How many shares you have
2025-07-11,"Nah, I remember people saying that back when we hit one trillion market cap. And here we are, a 4x since then (both in market cap and stock price, approximately.)."
2025-07-11,"It’s healthcare but nobody knows who it will be. Immortality is priceless and we will get close to it one day and those companies will be the next ai wave. 

Reddit isn’t useful for discovering new stocks  it’s just echo chamber and meme stocks and hopping on bandwagons"
2025-07-11,"It's not going to drop to a ""comfy valuation"". If you wanted to buy it cheap you've had 4 years to get in. It might drop a bit but the floor for it now is far higher than it was a year ago and it will always demand a premium."
2025-07-16,"It had a fantastic run these past 2 months. Satellite phones are needed rn. Amazon, AT&T and I think Verizon partnered with them."
2025-07-16,I wish I knew how. I am not reddit proficient.
2025-07-12,"Been holding since last summer with an average of $157, before I added more last month"
2025-07-12,It’s communications and defence mainly in the medium term. I’m not bullish on space exploration or discovering other planets / materials etc - but if people want to pay to do that then it’s a bonus.
2025-07-12,What’s this one? I like the price!
2025-07-11,It still useful - got into asts and rklb a good while back because of reddit.
2025-07-11,Oh it definitely will drop I’m just being patient enough. I didnt have the opportunity to get in 4 years ago but seeing its price now it will 100% fall much lower
2025-07-11,Acquisition news
2025-07-12,I was wondering what happened! Are you buying more or just holding what you have?
2025-07-12,"Its Coreweaves younger, hungrier and debt free brother. It's currently in a buying dip but when its back on track. Let's just say the skies the limit"
2025-07-11,By your definition it is pure speculation. So I should just go buy first gen Charizard pokemon cards because they are becoming rarer and I will assume someone will spend more on it in the future.
2025-07-12,Fair point. It is good for what’s hot now. Harder for the far out future. It used to be but now too many people make it their full time job to find this stuff out. In the past it was a niche group with interesting insight.
2025-07-11,"""I missed the opportunity when it went up 400% last year so I'm hoping I'm right""

Same people who missed the Tesla run up and cry about it constantly. 

Ya know what, instead of just waiting for it to drop, since you 100% know it's going to fall lower, why not just short it and get rich?"
2025-07-12,"I bought 100 shares of NVDA in December 2022 presplit for $175 a share, it dropped to $143 and I sold to harvest the tax loss thinking I’d buy back in 30 days later.    I never got the chance.  I just lost $150k of gains because I thought it would “test the lows” again"
2025-07-13,"You are so confidence, 100% confidence, that it will fall much lower. Then the best way for you to start this is to buy  put. You will 100% make money."
2025-07-12,Yea. Anyone looked into CoreScientific being acquired? I bought some shares but it tanked as well.
2025-07-14,Check out the companies Nebius owns as well…. Avride-autonomous cars for example. Good long run!!
2025-07-11,"No those have unlimited supply and are bad stores of value, btc had beaten every currency and asset for years now for a reason. We have 11 years of data proving this man use your brain."
2025-07-11,"It is about small steps.  Qbits. Sure we may not achieve true quantum speeds for long time, but that doesn’t mean you just write off the entire industry. Lol"
2025-07-11,"I wasent into investing till last year around June, my core philosophy’s and beliefs don’t align with shorting stocks, I believe in buying good businesses at good prices which is simple to understand, I know I’m right it will dip I never missed pltr as I was never even looking at stocks!!! Tesla is a doomed company based all on hype and speculation, even if I missed out on gains I don’t buy into speculation. I was watching its price 2024 around October I believe and literally called it to dip because of its valuation which it did. You don’t have to be defensive it’s a discussion bro"
2025-07-12,"I was in PLTR in the beginning but dropped out because of the implications of what the company was becoming. I do not want a surveillance state, so I decided to get out. Same with Tesla, I am no longer investing in companies that directly go against what I believe in."
2025-07-11,"It will take a while for stocks to drop, there will be a recession either late this year or mid next. Pltr is due for a correction impossible to know when. Earnings this quarter will be huge on stock prices."
2025-07-13,"I would short but I can’t be certain it won’t rise again before it drops, it’s impossible to know. I don’t bet on shorting"
2025-07-11,people are dumb and slow to process news
2025-07-11,"You don't know you're right. If you're new to investing and can claim that you know what the market is going to do then you are straight delusional. 

If you do have a crystal ball and know what stocks are going to do then you'd be a rich man"
2025-07-11,"So, while you only got into investing last year, you know pltr will dip. Noted. LOL."
2025-07-12,"Lol good luck with that. What exactly does Tesla do that is against your beliefs? Don't believe in electric cars?

I'll invest in what makes me money and builds financial stability for my family. There are no moral companies in a capitalistic society fyi"
2025-07-28,Don't care. Have made tens of thousands off of it and will continue to buy and make a couple hundred thousands to pay for my kids college and early retirement
2025-07-13,The strategy for put =/= short. I’ll be honest. It doesn’t sound like you are halfway competent yet when it comes to investment.  Suggest you get more learnings while parking your money in ETF or index for now until you get sufficiently proficient.
2025-07-11,"I will be rich in the future from stocks you don’t know to what extent I want it so badly, i definitely can’t say it’s impossible for it to not happen but I’m extremely confident in my statements."
2025-07-12,"I don't believe in the CEO who builds mecha Nazi AI bots, and Seig Heils at political rallies. Someone who also performed illegal election interference by offering money to people to vote for Trump and tampering with voting machines. The money Tesla made him went directly into funding these types of things which I do not want to support. 

I do support NVDA, they are progressing technology, building the platform for AI, service GeForce Now, and are a cool company. Yes, their processors may power weapons, and can indirectly support super computers and servers used by companies like PLTR, but it also supports many things that aren't what I view as evil.

I get that we live in a capitalistic world and it's everyone for themselves, but I do not want to directly fund the downfall of the country I love. For this, I will stand the high ground, but you can do what you believe in and feel what is right for you. That's the beauty of our country, we have the freedom to do so.... For now...."
2025-07-28,"I hope for you it works out. My concern would be that governments typically invest in shit software, that they are pltr main client and that most that would buy pltr already bought pltr so there is not a lot of growth to be had. On the other hand, governments are also notably terrible at getting good prices for the shit softwares they buy so the profit margins are there to be had."
2025-07-13,"I don’t know enough about shorting it’s not in my personal interest and I have never looked at it, I’m most definitely competent with investing and everything surrounding."
2025-07-11,"If you want them so badly why haven't you already made money from the information you guarantee and use that to buy them now?

Or maybe you can admit the only reason you have brown eyes is because you're so full of shit that it stacks up that high"
2025-07-12,Dude I just went through your post history; you literally asked 23 days ago if PLTR will dip and if you should buy the dip. You are something else my guy.
2025-07-13,Anyone who says 100% confident about stock price movement is clueless. Good luck.
2025-07-12,"I think you have your own problems, no one has to hate as much as you I’m speaking to you in a humanly matter idk why my opinions and beliefs annoy you so much? I may be confident but doesn’t mean you have to agree with what I say. There’s no point arguing on the internet trying to say I’m full of crap I’m this im that etc. I hope your investment journey goes well my friend"
2025-07-12,I would have made a 76% unrealised return in April which I was extremely closely to buying the low but I believe it could potentially full furhter so I waited.
2025-07-14,Stop being negative.what is your problem?This is a place for people to share good ideas and you being toxic.
2025-07-12,I know it will dip and I will most likely buy have to dive into them fully
2025-07-16,"No lib here, funding Palentier is crazy, won’t matter if you made 400% when you have a camera up your  ⭐️ and is currently harvesting your social media comments to weigh whether your a good citizen or not. Anyone can sell their kidneys and brag for an hour."
2025-07-13,"I’m definitely not clueless, anyone with a third of a brain cell would know pltr is going to drop in its share price I am 100% confident it will. I can not tell you a date or time but it will it’s how it works, stocks trading at extreme valuations always correct or return to a lower level it’s basic investing you should have learnt when first starting."
2025-07-11,Just gotta sit back and make money.  Feels good to be retired and make money everyday.
2025-07-11,Need to hold over 4 trillion. Lots of buying and free advertising on the news.
2025-07-11,"I'm convinced it will hit 250
$4 trillion makes no sense. But it apparently does.


$250 by end of year?"
2025-07-11,Shouldn’t Nvidia revenue be 1T annually if it’s trading at 4 trillion market cap? Or valuation is irrelevant once you hit the trillion mark?
2025-07-10,More sellers than buyers? 😭
2025-07-10,"Really man? 

It dropped $2. This is how the stock market works. If you are staring at it this hard, wondering why a stock can drop a percent, you need to sell and get out."
2025-07-10,"If you guys sell your shares, I’ll buy them"
2025-07-10,"Profit taking, plain and simple. NVDA has hit a threshold where more investors are comfortable selling than they are buying, so it drops a little."
2025-07-10,"I saw that. Sold with $6k profits since Monday. 

I'll wait to see how far things drop. Will buy back several stocks later today,"
