# Forecasting Stock Price Trends with NLP Model of Market Sentiment Data
stock-nlp-forecast

This project explores approaches to forecast daily stock price trends by combining traditional quantitative metrics with market sentiment data mined from Reddit API using NLP tool of VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner). The pipeline integrates real-time stock data with sentiment analysis from Reddit posts and comments to uncover meaningful patterns in financial markets.

I completed this project during my visiting studies at the University of Michigan for DATASCI415: Data Mining and Statistical Learning.
