2025-10-16,Apple’s 14-inch MacBook Pro leaps forward with M5 chip and AI performance boost,"The new 14-inch MacBook Pro introduces Apple’s M5 chip, promising up to 3.5× faster AI performance compared to its predecessor and 1.6× better graphics. Each GPU core in M5 includes a Neural Accelerator, supporting on-device AI tasks, LLMs, and generative workflows. The laptop can achieve up to 24 hours of battery life, even during demanding tasks. Storage is faster too — up to 2× the SSD speed over the prior model — allowing for quicker loading of large AI models or media files. 

With features like a Liquid Retina XDR display, 12MP Center Stage camera, six-speaker system, and macOS Tahoe with built-in Apple Intelligence, Apple positions this as a powerful “AI-ready” pro laptop at the same starting price of $1,599."

2025-10-15,Can Apple hit $5T before Cook hands over to Ternus?,"Seeing all these reports about John Ternus being positioned as the next CEO got me thinking about what comes next for Apple. Cook has done an incredible job taking the company from $347 billion to around $3.7 trillion, but we're still sitting at that gap between where we are now and the $5 trillion milestone. The timing feels crucial here, with leadership transition potentially happening in the next few years and Apple facing some real challenges in AI where they're clearly behind Google and Microsoft.

What's interesting is comparing the environments both CEOs operated in. Jobs had the advantage of creating entirely new product categories when competition was less intense, while Cook has had to navigate a much more regulated landscape with antitrust scrutiny and geopolitical tensions. The next CEO, whether it's Ternus or someone else, will need to figure out how to innovate beyond the iPhone while dealing with supply chain complexity and catching up in AI. I'm genuinely curious whether we'll hit that $5 trillion under Cook's watch or if it becomes the first major achievement for his successor."

* **📉 Valuation:** Apple trades at a premium. Earnings yield is **2.6%**, earnings-to-price **3.8%**, book-to-price **1.7%**, revenue-to-price **10.7%**, and cash flow-to-price **2.9%** — all indicating limited value and a rich valuation.
* **📈 Growth:** Revenue grew **7.2%**, earnings **2.1%**, and projected earnings growth is **9.3%**. Growth remains positive but shows the company’s maturing business profile.
* **💰 Profitability:** Apple’s strength. Return on equity is **154.9%**, return on assets **29.9%**, net profit margin **24.3%**, and ROIC **47.6%**, all world-class figures.
* **⚖️ Debt Structure:** Balance sheet is strong. Debt-to-market cap is **2.7%**, debt-to-equity **154.5%**, and debt-to-assets **30.7%**, all manageable levels.
* **📊 Momentum:** Momentum is stable and positive, with strong short-term performance (**3M: +24.5%**) and solid medium- and long-term trends (**6M: +17.2%**, **12M: +12.9%**).
* **🧱 Stability:** Revenue volatility (**12.8%**) and earnings volatility (**4.5%**) indicate stable cash flows.
* **💸 Dividend:** Yield is modest at **0.4%** (5Y avg. **0.5%**), but a **15.5%** payout ratio leaves room for future increases.
* **🧠 Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are neutral (**Rating: 2.0**) with price potential at **-4.8%**.

✅ **Conclusion:** Apple remains a *profitability powerhouse* with stable fundamentals and positive momentum. However, its expensive valuation and moderate growth suggest that **future returns could be steady but not spectacular**. Major upside would likely require a new growth catalyst beyond its current product cycle."

Demand is skewing toward the Pro and Pro Max models, where shipping times have stretched to 18–25 days — longer than last year’s cycle. While the A19 chip brings a 20% speed boost, the phones notably lack AI features, and the China launch of the iPhone Air is delayed pending eSIM licensing.

Last but not least, what do we want the iPhone to accomplish via AI, when we way Apple is behind AI? I have Grok in my Tesla, it doesn't do anything to my car, it's just a cool AI companion to talk to.

Alexa has gotten smarter, but with every new update something breaks, so I have turned off Alexa+.

Gemini, ChatGPT are of course adding value to our daily lives, I just don't see what substantial value can they add to our iPhone usage.

I do agree that Siri is dumb and needs to become smarter. I just don't see how it can make my iPhone smarter. I am making 5% on my Apple holding and it's 10% of my individual stock portfolio. It's my smallest money-maker, but I am gonna hold it, because I know it has no way to go but up.

What do you, Apple stockholders think about the short term and long term future of this stock?"

If tradition holds, preorders will open Sept. 12 and in-store sales will begin Sept. 19. Analysts also expect updates to Apple Watch and AirPods, alongside iterative improvements to processors, cameras, and displays on the new iPhone models. The announcement follows recent launches from Samsung and Google, both pushing foldable big-screen phones, while Apple is rumored to be preparing its own folding iPhone for late next year. 

On the news, AAPL rose 1% to close at 229.31, though BofA cautioned the reveal could become a classic “sell-the-news” event as shares remain in a 35-week consolidation with a buy point at 260.10."

2025-08-27,Apple Financial Updates And News On $490M Investor Settlement,"Hey guys, I already mentioned this case before, but since there’s fresh news, I wanted to share again.

Back in 2018, Apple ($AAPL) was riding high and telling investors that China wasn’t a problem for iPhone sales. Tim Cook even said they were feeling pressure in places like Brazil, India, Russia, and Turkey — but not China. Then suddenly, just two months later, Apple shocked everyone by slashing its revenue forecast by $9 billion, blaming weak demand in China.

That revelation crushed $AAPL stock by about 10% in a single day. Investors then filed a lawsuit, claiming Apple misled them about how badly iPhone sales in China were hit by the trade war, cheaper battery swaps, and local competition.

Now here’s the update — Apple has agreed to settle for $490 million with investors to resolve those claims. The class period runs from November 2, 2018 to January 2, 2019.

So if you held Apple during that stretch, you could [qualify for part of the payout](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).

2025-08-27,I like the company,"TL;DR - Apple’s been left out of the AI hype, but the next 3–6 months are lining up: iPhone 17 cycle + Services price hikes + aligning AI strategy to existing product roadmap

**iPhone 17 ?? ==>** Apple Intelligence bundled straight into iPhone 17 is the upgrade driver. Supply chain checks already pointing to solid demand, which IMO could be the the start of the next cycle.

**Services price hike is a nice bump** ==> Over 1B subs, Record revenue, And now quietly raising prices across Apple One / TV+ / Music which is boosting ARPU without spiking churn. That’s recurring cash flow and margin expansion in one move, I also like.

**AI Re-Rate Incoming** ==> Yeah, the market ignored Apple’s AI story at first, but thats really been the case for every major product annoucement at apple. As Apple Intelligence actually ships with the new iphone + the iphone 16 and gets real traction, sentiment will shift fast, like will litterly take one release to change this whole lame narrative.

**3–6 Month View**: Stock’s been (somewhat) snoozing while the big names ran to unsustainable levels. Going into q4, we've got hardware + services + narrative all working together.

**Also as a side note, this is really just how I view it. I'm a long term holder and don't care if you agree or disagree, especially the apple haters on here who for whatever reason love to bash even though they don't know the 1st thing their talking about.** A.k.a I don't want to hear your AI interpretation of whats going on.

The suit alleges anticompetitive practices related to their collaboration, which has raised concerns among investors about potential regulatory scrutiny and market dynamics. This legal challenge comes at a time when the tech sector is already facing volatility, and it has led to increased speculation about the implications for AAPL's market position and future growth. Additionally, analysts are closely monitoring the upcoming iPhone 17 launch, which could further influence stock performance amid these developments."

Analysts estimate Apple TV+ ended 2024 with around 40M subscribers — well below Netflix’s 300M and Disney’s 228M — despite heavy investment in originals like *Severance*, *Ted Lasso*, and *The Morning Show*. Reports say the service still loses more than $1B a year, even after spending over $5B annually on content, though Apple trimmed that by $500M in 2024.

2025-08-11,$AMD and $NVDA agree to pay 15% of China chip sales to the US govt in exchange for export licenses.,"The bad: This feels like pseudo state capitalism. Something that **China** does, not the United States of America. Requiring a publicly listed company to share **revenue** from **sales** with the state is a slippery slope. What's next, State owned enterprises?

The good: This does provide more certainty to investors and chipmakers worrying about export bans. The price and terms are set and now chip makers can access China and predict revenues more consistently. 85% revenue from china sales is better than 0%

From a 10,000 foot view, this is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It allows US chipmakers to export AI infra and dictate terms. The alternative would be no sales to China, potentially opening the door for China to get a leg up in the AI race and exporting their AI infra to the world.

2025-08-09,Cook just dodged a $100B tariff bullet - thoughts on AAPL's next move?,"Honestly, I didn't expect Cook to pull this off so smoothly. AAPL jumped 5%+ after announcing their American Manufacturing Program while I watched other chipmakers get absolutely wrecked by Trump's 100% semiconductor tariff threat. What impresses me most is how they're not just blindly reshoring everything - they're keeping the expensive fab work in the US but still outsourcing assembly to stay competitive. Meanwhile companies like Renesas are bleeding because they bet everything on staying overseas.

https://preview.redd.it/6f9cugs0uzhf1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=b57eec79da79102997903d45deae3a4335745165

I've been tracking this trend on tiger and other platforms, and the market is clearly rewarding any company with a US manufacturing story right now. My take? This isn't just about dodging tariffs - Cook essentially just reset the entire semiconductor supply chain playbook. Every other chipmaker is now scrambling to announce their own US plans or risk getting left behind. The crazy part is Apple gets to claim ""Made in America"" while still keeping costs reasonable through their hybrid approach. Wonder if this forces other FAANG companies to follow suit with their own manufacturing strategies."

2025-08-08,AAPL Thesis = Confirmed,"You all know how bullish I’ve been on Apple even when sentiment was weak, but now that earnings are out, the thesis I posted weeks ago is playing out exactly as expected. The post-earnings action just confirmed everything. Position still intact and as confident as ever, **HA suck it H8ters**

**TL;DR:** Apple’s recent underperformance was driven by market-wide AI hype elsewhere, but the fundamentals never wavered. With a record breaking Services quarter, continued execution on privacy-first AI, and a long term supply chain strategy gaining momentum, Apple’s setup has only improved.

**Services = Still ⛽️**: Apple’s Services segment once again proved it’s the most stable part of the business. With $23.9B in Q3 revenue (a new all-time high) and over one billion paid subscriptions, this high-margin, recurring-revenue engine continues to scale. As other companies chase AI monetization stories, Apple is quietly turning its install base into predictable cash flow. This is the foundation of the long-term thesis — and it’s working.

**AI Lag Was the Setup**: While names like Microsoft, Meta, and Google rallied off AI driven beats, Apple was left out of the party. That created the opportunity. Apple Intelligence may not have wowed traders on announcement day, but it’s fully integrated, privacy-first, and designed to drive upgrades, not just headlines. 

**Supply Chain Diversification**: The post earnings macro boost wasn’t just about the top line. Apple committed another $100B to U.S. manufacturing, bringing total domestic investment to $600B. This comes alongside its ongoing shift to India and Vietnam (all part of the same strategic move to derisk from China and reduce tariff exposure). That long term planning is being rewarded now, as the company positions itself to navigate policy and geopolitics better than most.

**Earnings Beat = Thesis Confirmed**: Apple posted $94B in revenue and $1.57 in EPS, beating expectations across the board. iPhone revenue grew 13.5% YoY, Services hit a record, and the company saw a solid stock reaction with follow-through in the days after. The stock’s underperformance wasn’t about the business it was about narratives. This quarter flipped the script.

I should get them back.  etc.. I think growth  in the software-chip space might be worth atleast a consideration?  The semi fabricators like ASML and LAM are good values.  The ASML CEO is new and shot himself and his company in the foot with his wining about tariffs.  Notice how all the companies that wine about trump and his tariffs drop rapidly after earning while those who focus on their own growth zoom. This is a sea change worth noting.

Revenue from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store has accelerated month to date in July, especially in the U.S. and is showing no negative effects so far from the Epic Games v. Apple ruling, according to Morgan Stanley.

U.S. App Store revenue has surged 12.5% year over year over the first 20 days of July, according to Morgan Stanley, citing data from Sensor Tower. This followed 11.5% year-over-year growth in June. Meanwhile, App Store revenue in China is up 7.1% year over year, but down 1.9% in Japan. It's up 21% year over year in the rest of the world.

""If the September quarter ended on July 20th, App Store net revenue would be growing 12.6% Y/Y, tracking 210bps above our +11.0% Y/Y forecast, and translating to 60bps of upside (or ~$160M) to our September-quarter Services growth forecast of 11.7% Y/Y (vs. Consensus estimate of +10.8% Y/Y), all else equal,"" said Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Erik Woodring, in a Tuesday note.

What's more, the investment firm finds that App Store revenue continues to increase despite the recent ruling from the Epic Games v. Apple suit.

""After more than two months since the Apple vs. Epic injunction, we still have not seen meaningful impact on Apple's ability to monetize the US App Store, despite the link-out risk,"" Woodring said.

Apple is slated to release its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results on July 31. A consensus estimate calls for earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $88.89B."

2025-07-02,Leaked info that Apple is planning on introducing a flip phone next year,"Translated: 
Apple (Apple) supply chain sources revealed:
In June, Apple began the prototype phase (P1 – Prototype 1) of the foldable iPhone. It is expected that the prototype development process will be completed by the end of 2025, after which it will enter the EVT (Engineering Verification Test) phase. According to this timeline, the foldable iPhone is likely to be launched in the second half of 2026.

Supply chain sources also stated that Apple’s original new product planning included not only a foldable iPhone but also a larger foldable iPad.

As of now, it is expected that the foldable iPhone will be launched first, while the foldable iPad is temporarily shelved. The delay is reportedly due to difficulties in component production (such as display panels), high estimated prices, and potentially low market acceptance.

There have been many rumors about a foldable iPhone in the past, but they have all remained in the “rumor-only” stage. Now that almost all Android brands have already released foldable phones, Apple’s supply chain has finally been activated.

Industry insiders revealed that this product has already been in development for more than 5 years, with the number of design revisions exceeding double digits. Suppliers had remained cautious, but now finally believe it has a “real chance” to reach the market."

2025-06-29,I’m all in on AAPL calls,"AAPL - P/E is trading way under their norm, they are the worse performing MAG7 this year and usually when the stars align, you go all in on the worst MAG7 because they eventually rebound. They only have upside, as I am confident that there will be a tariff relief rally, and their Foundations Models Framework presented at WDC25 is the true game changer. While everyone was crapping on AAPL for their Liquid Glass Interface (which is an optional setting), the herd totally missed the real play here - Foundations Models is like electricity for AI. You don't build a power plant to run your business—you just plug into the grid - Apple just became the grid for AI developers. In other words, with developers now having enterprise-AI within the apple ecosystem, then apps will become so much more enhanced because they will be ingrained in daily life. Every intelligent iOS app becomes a reason why users won't switch. And it's worth way more than any AI subscription would be. As usual Apple is late to the party. But, First to win!"
2025-06-29,Growth Opportunities!?,"Guys, let‘s just have a relaxed coffee and speculate about new growth opportunities for Apple.
I‘m invested in Apple since 2019 and since then I‘m speculating in my head what could Apple do to start the next huge growth story…i went from 
- „Omg Apple Car is going to be huge“, to 
- „Omg Apple Glasses are going to be huge“, to:
- „AI is obviously the next big thing  -  I didn‘t even know that this kind of tech exist“

So what could Apple do to path the way to 4/5/6tn market cap?

My takes:
- expanding services like „Apple Connect +“ with Globalstar. Sat Connect data and cell packages (Short on Tmobile!)
- buying a new company for „not-organic-growth“
- selling their M-series chips to customers (i don‘t really think that they would do this)

The problem is that Wall St. starting to think that their execs are boomers who don’t get new technology. They are stingy to a fault. They really should spend money to buy some companies even if their profits are not there yet. Money should be no object.

If they buy Rivian and Enphase, it will send signals that they are ready to eat the electrification market share. It will also send signals that they are ready to eat the car market share. Something that is core to American lifestyle.

If they buy Antrophic, it will send signals that they take AI seriously and ready for the next decade of growth.

To balance the buying, Apple should also make their chips datacenter ready. They have all the ingredients to compete B2B with Nvidia. Container/VM story is there. Spend the extra engineering effort to optimize their GPU for Containerized Linux. Bam. That’s it.

Apple needs a growth story, not fundamentals. Through new SKUs. Mac and iPad will never break double digit billion per quarter."

2025-06-25,Apple may acquire Perplexity for $14 billion? Thought?,"
1. Perplexity is reportedly valued at $14 billion — if the deal goes through, it would be Apple's largest acquisition ever, nearly 4.7 times its previous record: the $3 billion Beats acquisition.

2. Beats currently holds the top spot at $3 billion, followed by HopStop at $110 million, and Intel’s modem business at $100 million. Most other Apple acquisitions have been below $110 million, making the potential Perplexity deal unprecedented in scale.

3. The move signals Apple’s intensified push into AI, aiming to acquire cutting-edge technology and key talent through high-stakes M&A.

4. While such a high-premium deal comes with integration risks, it could significantly accelerate Apple’s development of a robust AI ecosystem.

Not a great look, especially with the broader tech space trying to shake off regulatory heat.

What’s interesting is that while their core products remain strong, these legal challenges are starting to pile up, and it feels like investor sentiment is getting more cautious. Some analysts are still bullish, but you can tell the mood is shifting a bit.

2025-06-16,AAPL technical analysis: $193 is the critical support level - here's my options strategy,"AAPL is sitting at one of the most critical technical junctures we've seen this year. The $193 level has been tested multiple times and represents strong institutional buying interest. A break below could trigger algorithmic selling, potentially sending AAPL back to April lows around $164-169. Volume analysis shows significant accumulation around this zone, which gives me confidence in this support level.

If $193 holds firm, I'm looking at upside targets of $205-207 for the first resistance (previous consolidation zone), with a major target at $220-225 representing the all-time high retracement. In the ultimate bull case scenario, we could see new ATH above $237.

AAPL has indeed lagged the ""Magnificent 7"" recently, but this creates an interesting asymmetric opportunity. The market's perception of ""lack of innovation"" may be overblown - remember, Apple's strength has always been in execution and ecosystem integration, not just flashy announcements. Key fundamental catalysts to watch include iPhone 16 sales data with AI integration driving upgrades, services revenue growth from their highest margin segment, China market recovery signals, and potential new product categories.

Given this technical setup, I'm using a strategic put-selling approach around the $193 level. Using Tiger Options' advanced analysis tools, I can precisely calculate the risk/reward for my sell put strategy. If I'm bullish long-term but want to potentially acquire shares at a discount, this approach makes sense. The platform's P&L analysis feature helps me visualize exactly how much premium I collect versus potential assignment risk, while the Greek analysis shows how Delta and Theta calculations work in my favor through time decay.

The real-time options chain on Tiger Options makes it easy to spot optimal strike prices and expiration dates that align with my $193 thesis. I particularly appreciate the IV screening feature, which helps me identify options with attractive implied volatility levels for selling premium.

Despite short-term volatility, Apple's track record of reinvention speaks for itself. From iPod to iPhone to iPad to Services to Wearables, each transition initially faced skepticism, but long-term shareholders have been consistently rewarded. My base case remains that $193 holds, leading to a strong bounce toward ATH retracement. The delayed rotation into AAPL could actually work in our favor as institutional money seeks value in quality names.

Whether using options strategies or direct equity positions, always size positions appropriately, have clear exit plans for both scenarios, and consider using stop-losses below key technical levels. The beauty of using Tiger Options is that I can practice these strategies risk-free with their $1M virtual portfolio before committing real capital.


What's your take on AAPL's current setup? Are you seeing the same technical signals around $193?

2025-06-16,"$AAPL If you are Apple and you are raking in the profits from your iPhone sales, you can make a lot of those profits just disappear from your taxable income,” said Alexander Arnon, a senior policy analyst at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School budget model team.","The Irish government opened the country’s doors to multinational corporations following an economic crisis that unfurled through the 1980s. Unemployment in the country spiked and a wave of migration followed. 

  
AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, AVGO, and BGM may benefit from continued global tax optimization strategies and multinational-friendly jurisdictions that support tech and innovation-driven growth.

“That was clearly a driver of the tax strategy to make it even more attractive in the ’90s. It helped that Ireland became part of the EU,” said Kevin Kent, transatlantic practice chair at law firm Clark Hill."

2025-06-10,Apple's AI lag - opportunity or trap at $200?,"Apple's not perfect, but let's be real—it's still a cash cow with insane brand power. AI might be lagging, but I'm betting long.

Yes, Apple is behind in the AI race. While Google and Microsoft are making headlines with ChatGPT integrations and AI-first strategies, Apple's approach feels... cautious. Maybe too cautious. But here's what the market might be missing: when Apple does roll out AI features, they'll be deeply integrated across the ecosystem. Think Siri 2.0 that actually works, seamless AI photo editing, and predictive text that doesn't suck. Their privacy-first approach could be a differentiator in AI, especially as regulatory scrutiny increases. While others rush to collect data, Apple's on-device processing could become the gold standard.

That $165B+ cash position gives them flexibility to acquire or develop AI capabilities quickly. They've done this playbook before—remember when they were ""late"" to streaming with Apple TV+? The upcoming WWDC could be make-or-break for sentiment. If they announce meaningful AI integrations in iOS 26 or surprise us with AR/AI crossover features, we could see a quick sentiment shift. Historical patterns show Apple often rises before keynotes, then faces the ""sell the news"" pressure.

But if it's just incremental updates and more Memoji features, the AI narrative weakness continues. The risk is real—three consecutive months of decline suggest sustained bearish sentiment isn't just about broader markets.

At current levels, the risk-reward looks decent for patient investors. Being the worst performer in Mag 7 often sets up comeback stories, but timing matters. I spotted this potential entry point last week but my main trading capital was still tied up in other positions. Ended up using my Tiger CBA account to grab some shares around $201—sometimes you can't wait for perfect timing when the setup looks right. The interest-free period gives me breathing room to see how WWDC plays out without the pressure of immediate settlement.

Apple's P/E ratio still isn't screaming ""bargain,"" and macroeconomic headwinds could keep pressure on regardless of AI progress. Consumer spending on premium devices faces real challenges, and even great WWDC announcements might not translate to immediate revenue. But here's the thing—Apple rarely stays down for long. Their execution ability has consistently turned skeptics into believers. The question isn't whether they'll figure out AI, but when.

Apple might be late to AI, but they're rarely late to profits. At $200, I'm willing to bet on their execution ability over their innovation speed. Sometimes the best opportunities come when everyone's writing the obituary.

What's your take on Apple's AI strategy? Too little, too late, or strategic patience paying off?"

2025-06-08,NVDA did it so will AAPL,"Very interesting positioning into next week. 
$SPY closed the week right at $600 psychological level, a clean breakout spot.

$AAPL Closed above the apex of the months long triangle wedge = technical breakout 

If WWDC delivers real AI substance, Apple could begin to outperform the market even lead SPY to new highs

Breakdown: why retesting or getting near the upper wedge ($230 area) is critical:

⸻

The Significance of the Upper Descending Broadening Wedge

1. Multiple Touch = Valid Trendline
	•	Apple’s upper wedge line has 2+ major rejection points (circled), confirming its validity.
	•	A third or fourth touch, especially after a breakout from a tighter wedge, is textbook price behavior — the market respects these levels before it decides.

2. $230 is a Psychological & Technical Target
	•	It aligns with the measured move of the triangle breakout.
	•	Also acts as a “magnet” zone where sellers previously controlled, and where institutions may want to re-evaluate risk.

3. NVDA = Patience Before Explosion
	•	NVDA’s price knocked on the wedge ceiling 3x (Jan 7, Jan 24, Feb 18), just like Apple is lining up to do.
	•	Only after testing it enough — and building higher lows beneath it — did NVDA explode above.
	•	Once it cleared the wedge, NVDA never looked back, running over 100% in months."

2025-06-04,"AAPL holding strong at $200 support, my favorite big tech play right now","Among all the big tech stocks in my portfolio, $AAPL remains my personal favorite. Sure, it doesn't offer a high dividend yield, but the stability in price movement is what keeps me coming back.
I've been relatively quiet with trading in April and May, but looking back at my transaction history, I noticed I made several sales in the $206-213 range. Based on this pattern, I'm planning my next exit strategy around the $207 mark.

What's interesting is that Apple is the only major tech company that hasn't approached its 200-day moving average and has been somewhat left out of the broader market rally. But here's the thing about Apple - it has this uncanny ability to bounce back when you least expect it. Sometimes when everyone gets tired and starts selling, that's exactly when AAPL decides to moon.
I learned this lesson the hard way last year when I got impatient and sold too early, only to watch it surge afterward. That's a mistake I won't make again.

The $200 level is proving to be solid support, and the back-and-forth action between bulls and bears over the past two months has actually been pretty entertaining to watch.

For those looking to get into AAPL or any other stocks, I've been using Tiger Brokers lately - their platform makes it easy to track these support levels with clean charts and real-time data. Plus, you can start with fractional shares from just $1, which is perfect for building positions gradually around key levels like this $200 support.

Anyone else eyeing this support level for an entry point?
